0,1.0,"I purchased two of these cards almost exactly 4 months ago, in preparation for some fall releases. I've bought a lot of digital cash cards for PSN from Amazon, it's an easy way to use credit or to tuck something away to save for later, when I KNOW I want a game.. I used one code early September and was prepared to use one the day before Red Dead Redemption 2 came out. Unfortunately, it did not deposit the $60 into my account. Instead, I get this error from Sony. ""The code you entered is inactive. Please check terms and conditions."" I try multiple browsers, multiple devices.. I contact Amazon and I'm told it's not their problem, it's on Sony. I contact Sony, send them the code itself and the purchase information. 2 days later, I hear back. It's not their problem, it's ""the retailer's."" I contact Amazon again and get told that I can no longer get a refund, they can't do anything and how would $3 in credit make me feel?. Don't buy digital codes from Amazon. I was unaware there was a ticking clock on it, I was given no indication that I would have to use in X amount of time and now I'm out $60 and Amazon will do nothing.. DON'T BUY DIGITAL CODES FROM AMAZON. You never know when they just might not work and you're screwed out of your money.",$10 PlayStation Store Gift Card [Digital Code],-0.01979166666666667,0.23020833333333335
1,5.0,"Amazon wants to know what I think about this item, a digital code for $10 of credit on the Playstation Store. There's almost nothing that I could tell you about this that you don't already know if you're actually looking for Playstation Store credit. You buy this item, and a minute or two later you can find the code in your digital codes section on Amazon along with instructions to redeem it and a link to go right to the redeem page with the code pasted in for you in case you're too impatient to read.. The codes have always worked for me and they've been delivered in seconds, which is more than I can say for Sony's own built-in payment methods which like to lock you out arbitrarily. Well, except when someone steals your account then suddenly Sony's got no problem draining the daily maximum of $150 from your bank account or credit line. Which is why you should get these cards instead of putting in money directly through a payment method on Sony's site, because nobody can steal money if you don't have a method of getting it from you. The best a thief can do if all you have is store credit is use your store credit to buy a small amount and they'll probably just go on because it's not even worth the time. Where on the other hand if they get $150 they can buy in game items and trade to another account and sell them for money.. Advantages:. Codes can be given to someone else as a gift. Delivered nearly instantly and easy to log in and apply the code. Credit in your account instead of a payment method means theft is more difficult. All the old codes are in your Amazon account so you can look back on how much money you wasted (wait, maybe that's a disadvantage). When you buy digital, a Gamestop executive weeps. Disadvantages:. Not a physical card so if you want to make a physical gift out of it, do it yourself. Credit in your account is never the amount you need exactly so there's leftovers you may not use for a while. Most games now charge tax so you won't actually be able to get a $10 game with a $10 card, you need a smidge more. Once in a while they run out of codes and they take their sweet time getting more in, which stinks if you want a game right now. Amazon will send you emails asking what you think about digital gift cards and suggesting more digital gift cards for your collection, since you're obviously a connoisseur of letters and numbers.

6,5.0,"My grandson got a Play Station 4 in October for his 13th birthday. I had no idea how the game works, how ordering the gift card would work, how the money would get from my cart to a format that he could spend or anything else, really. When we had our Christmas gathering on our side of the family, I told him what he was getting for a gift, and he and I ordered it together that day. We were at my home, I ordered it on my Amazon account, it went into my cart, and I paid for it, just as I would any other purchase. After payment, I rcvd the digital code, which I wrote down, being very careful to get it exactly right, then gave that to him. According to him and his dad (our son), they would enter that code into grandson's game console, his account would be credited the amount of the gift card for him to spend on whatever Play Station items he can buy for that amount of money....games or accessories or outfits (called ""skins"") for the make-believe, digital characters in the game (one of the silliest ways to waste money I've ever heard of!). My grandson was thrilled, his dad said he'd burn through it much too quickly, and I was glad that I no longer had to be the one to teach and guide and all that hard stuff. I can just be the granny who buys the gift card (with some help), then shake my head over how it's spent and the vastly different, digital world these kids grow up in!",$10 PlayStation Store Gift Card [Digital Code],-0.006658730158730165,0.3620634920634921

2,1.0,"In this modern age, there is a tendency to want everything really fast. That can be annoying sometimes. We as a society have lost our patience a little and maybe we need it back. That being said, when you offer a digital service, there absolutely needs to be an immediacy to the service. That's simply how it is.. One can be online and purchase items through a PS4 or X-Box Live account and finish the process in a matter of less than 20 seconds (assuming all your account data is stored). By contrast having to wait longer than 26 minutes (and it is going to be a LOT longer than that) for codes for SEN from a $100.00 digital gift card is simply too much. If you have the codes, and are selling the codes, work out a process to where when the purchase is made the Buyer has it ready to use RIGHT after check-out. You've got my money. INSTANTLY, by the way. Pending Verification for the code is total BS. PRE-verify whatever you need to on YOUR end, Amazon, as the Seller. Do not get my hard-earned and THEN go through some antiquated process.. I'm no tech genius but I do not need to be. Customer service is customer service, and it is either good or not good. This is not good. And I think that with tech being what it is this situation of waiting for the code is not something that HAS to be, it could be fixed for the betterment of the entire buying and enjoyment process of the purchaser.. EDIT (December 19. 2018). I have since bought a half dozen or so cards in denominations of 50 or 100. In some cases the download was immediate. In others? The pending verification process took OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF. Unacceptable. I tried to 'chat' with Amazon about it. Rajim gets on the chatbox, and essentially asks me to wait, then starts giving me info that I could have (and did) looked up somewhere on the Amazon site about account protection, fraud, etc., but doesn't really address the core issue. BTW, this has been my experience whenever I have contacted Amz customer service. I used to dance with them, and save these long, meandering chat texts that went nowhere and solved nothing for s's and g's. Now I just cut it off and accept that Amazon is a gigantic Super-Galactic Megalodon of Merchandise and it rules over all of Internet Shoppingdom. The rest of us just sort of bend over and, um...worship at its feet and hope we only get bit a few times. I'll get the code, but I'm not necessarily going to ENJOY the experience.

5,3.0,"As a long time Sony customer, I dislike more than I like the brand, its products and customer service. One of the things I hate (among others not relevant today) is that they charge 20% higher prices in other countries PS Stores, for exactly the same digital download - in US dollars. So I like to buy my games wherever else I can supporting alternative channels like Amazon; spending the same money, but taking a share away from Sony and fomenting competition. Not less important, I can pay with my local credit card whereas Sony only allows US-based cards in the PS US store. To add more injury, Sony does not allow me to ""carry"" my account with me from the US to my new residence country, forcing me to open a new account with a local credit card - while ""loosing"" my previous purchases or leave them associated in the old US account and messing up users and downloads in the console - while paying the 20% surcharge I told above.. So that goes for the positive for Amazon, which has been great for PS games and Gift Cards purchases.. HOWEVER, in this particular case, Amazon took about 1 day to make my digital code available. I could not undo nor use the purchased goods.

6,5.0,"USE THIS INSTANTLY. I facepalmed reading these reviews because some people thought you could just hold onto the code for months then redeem it later. My advice: redeem it the day you get it or a few days later at most. These codes stop working after a while. So please, redeem it quickly.. Usually I take many pictures for my reviews. Thing is, this isn‚Äôt a physical gift card. I think I like this more than gift cards. They just send you a code and in seconds you have your code ready to redeem. Could still work as a gift if you text the code to whoever you‚Äôre giving it to. But honestly you might be better off just going to a physical retailer like Walmart or Target if you want to actually get a physical gift card for them. I do see this as a nice alternative to using a debit/credit card or a paypal. If I ever got hacked and someone used my card to buy games I would definitely switch to buying physical games or buy digital codes from that point on. It happened to my sister and someone spent $300 with her card, money she really needed for rent. So honestly I feel like that can happen to anyone, make sure to be careful with your financials people. My two gripes is that the code could sometimes be invalid and probably the biggest gripe with this method as opposed to paypal or bank cards is the tax with digital purchases. Let‚Äôs say you want a $10 game. If you redeem a $10 code you don‚Äôt have enough since there‚Äôs a bit of tax. Funny thing is that sometimes the tax is literally just 20 cents. There is a method that supposedly works to get rid or tax by changing your postal code. Maybe I‚Äôll try it out but I can‚Äôt say for sure while writing this review that it works. Honestly the most convenient way is just a debit/credit card or paypal. I, however, am buying this for my 7-year old brother so he can get a game he wants and I didn‚Äôt want to put my financials on their PS4. I really like how quick this is, just put in the code and you‚Äôre set. But keep in mind what I said about tax. And please for the love of god, enter it as quickly as possible. Not several months after buying. Also read the code very carefully. This was almost a 1 star because I thought a 5 was an S, and of course with one single letter/number off it won‚Äôt work. I highly recommend it. But maybe buy a little more than the game is worth to cover tax. I‚Äôll try the postal code thing and see if that works.

If I am going to spend the better part of 8 hours staring at a computer, I might as well make it my own. So I dropped a couple of bucks and got a keyboard and mouse that would be complete overkill for an office environment... and it's perfect. Why? Because now my boring ol' office has some uniqueness to it, making me forget I am trapped at a desk. Now I am trapped at a desk with peripherals that are much better than anyone else. This may not be a big deal to you, but in my mind, it's better to do the mundane tasks on a keyboard that visually distracts me with colorful bliss. The mouse takes the feeling of dread I had from clicking that worn out stock mouse and gives me the excitement I need to not only click, but DOUBLE CLICK as well. I'm sure i could play games and other things with it too.. So why did I buy a gaming mouse and keyboard for an office computer? Because I'm awesome.

2,5.0,"I bought this combination, expecting it to work out of the box. The Keyboard is beautiful and does a fine job of working for what I intend it for. The mouse... No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.. Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.. One more item: Redragon makes it VERY clear that software is included with this package. It is most certainly NOT. And they go to great lengths to hide the software from the end user. I have found what I believe to be the software links, but plan to test before I share them here. I will bump up the review one notch if the package works out well over the long haul, but given the mouse issue right out of the gate and the promised software NOT being in the box plus the poor web site support to find the program, I cannot reasonably give Redragon a 5 star rating until these items are corrected.. Update: December 2019 - I was able to correct all the issues with that first mouse and the software works just fine. I've since bought this combination of mouse and keyboard 3 more times and had no issues. This truly is a great keyboard/mouse combination and I've made it a standard setup on the 3 gaming systems I've built to date.

7,1.0,"Not a lot to like on this combo. Even at this price point (under $30), it's hard to justify buying this.. 1. The main impression I got when I opened the package was how cheap it looked and felt. So plasticky. So unfinished. (Even before opening the package, I was surprised by how the vendor shipped it. No shipping box, no cushioning materials. It was shipped in the original product box with a mailing label slapped onto it. Talk about being cheap!). 2. The keyboard.. - The keyboard feels mushy, not crisp.. - Keys are NOT individually lit, instead groups of keys are lit. That, in itself isn't so bad, but about half the light bleeds out from under the sides of the keys - making the backlighting a distraction.. - The green and the yellow colors are barely adequate to work in daylight conditions, the other colors are just not bright enough.. - The number keys are disingenuously labeled. IMO, they are ""backward"". For example , the ""1"" on the one key is displayed on the top, while the ""!"" is on the bottom. Moreover, only the ""1"" is backlit, the ""!"" remains dark no matter what. So, it is difficult (impossible in the dark) to read any of the symbols below the numbers.. 3. The mouse.. - The mouse feels especially cheap. It must weigh an ounce, much too light to comfortably move around.. - It has an gritty finish that seems to rub off when touched. After a short period of time, my guess is that the rough finish will smooth out ... but meanwhile it's just plain uncomfortable to use.. - And the mouse doesn't change color, it's just plain red. Instead of enhancing the look of the mouse, the red led light seem to highlight the cheap plastic used in its manufacture.. - The buttons work, but they, too, feel cheap. Clickety cheap..

It's heavy, glides smoothly, the buttons are responsive, and the size is just right for my hands. That alone is worth the money, but I'm not focusing on the mouse in this review, but the keyboard.. This keyboard is a delight. Typing on it is comfortable, the keys are sturdy, give a nice tactile response, and aren't so loud as to wake sleeping members of the household as I type. There was a time when I could type 130 WPM with zero errors, but for years that number was severely reduced due to a number of issues: carpal tunnel, arthritis, and poorly made keyboards. Right now I'm typing around 110 WPM with zero errors, and the keyboard isn't even breaking a sweat. This is probably the best it will ever get for me, but I am already amazed. I never thought I'd be able to type this fast ever again, but the keyboard is laid out in such a way, with the keys themselves offering a terrific response that lets my fingers bounce from one key to another without any interference or lag, that I don't even feel like I'm straining at keeping up the pace.. I realize this isn't a mechanical keyboard, but it does feel like one. I mean, if you can't afford a mechanical keyboard, the Redragon Harpe K503RGB is a fantastic deal, and I haven't even got to the fun part yet: the lights!. As you know from the description, the keyboard lights up in a rainbow pattern, as well as 7 colors, including my two favorites: purple, and white. It also has a spectrum option which shows a steady rainbow that doesn't blink, or you can have one that ""breathes."" It's all rather lovely, and it's a dream for me to type at night. I touch type, but sometimes you need to see the keys, even in the dark, and I have no trouble seeing where my hands are placed, or where I'm going while I'm typing at night.. All in all, I got this combo for a steal. $30? It's easily worth twice that much, IMO. As a budget gamer, I never thought I'd be able to afford a keyboard and mouse with this kind of quality.

1,1.0,"So, what do I like about this set? Not a SINGLE thing. The mouse began to malfunction within about 10 days, and proved to be worthless for regular PC use, and even more useless of low level games ( like those on POGO) so for it to be promoted as a ""gaming set"" is absurd. (unless annoying flashing lights equals good performance in the eyes of gamers) It doesn't track and clicking is fairly hit and miss. About 1/3 of the times when you click it does nothing, and the side buttons are hair trigger and they shut screens and change where you are at the lightest brush. As of the AM it is in a thousand pieces, because the only pleasure I have gotten out of this POS waste of plastic was stomping it into oblivion after it closed out and lost a document when I brushed on of those side buttons with my thumb while trying to make the cursor move. If I could go punch the person who developed this POS in the mouth, I'd fly to China to do it. The keyboard is a whole 'nother thing...It is designed for people with very tiny hands apparently, and anyone with a sizable reach, who was trained on a typical/standard keyboard, will make constant typing mistakes...and honestly, the whole color thing is just freaking annoying, and you have to manually set it to the least annoying setting every time you restart your computer. Who needs that? Maybe a teenager who doesn't have anything real to accomplish on a computer, but not a normal human who has actual work to do. Beyond that, some keys you really have to strike fairly hard to make the keystroke register, other times if you brush the top of a button as you are moving around the keyboard to type, it will register that keystroke, so spelling mistake are an every single minute occurrence unless one types in the same manner as I was taught in High School typing class ( every keystroke performed with hands hovering about an inch over the keyboard, and my hands in full secretarial position.) I bought this POS set January 24, and today is April 27th, and I bought it because it had such high ratings for usability, and the price was decent...I wasn't expecting it to last more than a year or so, because that seems to be about the length of time and any keyboard and mouse will last these days, even with just average use. This POS lasted 3 months ( okay, I might have gotten another week out of it had I not taken the extreme pleasure of smashing the mouse...and the Keyboard is next as soon as I can shop in person for a new one that hopefully won't be yet another piece of crap) If it were possible to leave a negative rating for this crap set, I absolutely would.",Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo RGB Backlit Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys Wrist Rest and Red Backlit Gaming Mouse 3200 DPI for Windows PC Gamers (Black),-0.014346486846486846,0.48746871718025553

3,4.0,"Tactile feedback is good on the keyboard, but it's taking a bit of time for me to get used to the layout of the keyboard compared to my old trusty Dell keyboard that this was replacing. That, I'll chock up to just me needing more time to get used to it. The weights in the mouse make it feel nice. However, there is no official software for the keyboard, which resets back to rainbow puke every time I boot my computer, which with my ADHD is distracting. The website doesn't officially support the mouse anymore, but the M601-3 mouse drivers and software are compatible, which also helps to remap the buttons. Ordinarily I'd like to turn off the lights for this keyboard, but with them off, the keys are really dull, so I leave them on a solid red during use. Also, was afraid that my keyboard was broken on arrival, but it just doesn't work in a USB 2.0 port and needs USB 3.. In short:. Pros:. Looks nice. Keyboard is programmable for RGB. Great for typing at night. Keyboard and mouse have nice tactile feedback. Mouse buttons can be programmed. Shortcut buttons are nice.. Cons:. Layout may be slightly off compared to what you are used to. Keyboard loses your RGB settings if your PC is turned off. Software was a slight pain to find (You need Red Dragon USA, not the worldwide site, but if you are on the worldwide site, you can use the M601-3 driver download). Needs USB 3.0+ for the keyboard, USB 2.0 ports would not provide enough power for it to function.

5,1.0,"UPDATE: Changed to 1 star, wish I could select 0 stars. 1 star seems unfairly high. The mouse is unbearable. It regularly stops connecting to the computer for a fraction of a second which makes it impossible to use for gaming or most tasks. The mouse pointer itself will wiggle and move around on the screen in large arcs even without me touching the mouse or desk. Luckily I got a refund for it and I will be throwing these items in the trash. This was a huge waste of time and effort and I urge anyone reading this to choose a different brand.. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. The keys for the keyboard are very gummy feeling and don't seem very pleasant to type on. Not only that, but some of the keys are extremely unresponsive. I have to smash the shift key in order to get it to respond. I also bought it thinking that it came with keyboard software to reprogram keys and macros, which it does not. Also, I was very excited to have the colors on the keys and utilize the cool effects, but all of the effects are really loud. Like, when I put it on ""breathing"" mode I hear a reasonably loud electrical whine when it is cycling from on to off, to the point where I only use a solid color because it's so jarring to my ears.. As for the mouse, it is okay. The thumb buttons are really far forward for how I hold the mouse but I think they would work for other people. The texture on the mouse is very pleasant and I like the ability to add/remove weights. As for the responsiveness though, I bought a wired gaming mouse thinking it was going to be more responsive but it is not. It is pretty unresponsive and seems to drift a lot. There have been a lot of times where I am not even touching the mouse and the on-screen cursor is wiggling back and forth and drifting around.. All in all I would recommend getting something else.. Will it work? Yea.. Am I happy with the purchase? Absolutely not.. The product also arrived over a week late, which isn't the manufacturer's fault but I feel it necessary to include in the review.",Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo RGB Backlit Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys Wrist Rest and Red Backlit Gaming Mouse 3200 DPI for Windows PC Gamers (Black),0.16100340136054425,0.6608236525379383
6,4.0,"I bought the keyboard + mouse set as an upgrade from my previous keyboard. I had an old emachines keyboard that I dearly loved, but the print has worn off many keys and some of the keys take considerable pressure to function, so it was time to upgrade. I will be using this for coding and extensive word processing, not gaming, so that's what this review is based on.. Mouse: The mouse is nice. It's got a nice weight. The texture on the buttons gives it a good feel. It glides on the mousepad well with no skips. It's plug-and-play, although you need the driver in order to program the extra buttons. (see below) I haven't used the DPI switch, since I wont' need this for my work. The funny little contour points at the back end of the mouse are quite handy for moving the mouse around when selecting large amounts of text. No noticeable delay between click and computer response.. Keyboard: The keyboard is ok. I'm kind of a ""banger"" when it comes to typing (I press hard on the keys as I type.) But this keyboard makes considerably less noise than my last keyboard... much softer sound and keypress (if that makes any sense). I was hoping to have the static rainbow illumination for the backlight, but haven't figured out how to do that yet. (see below) My biggest complaint is that it's missing the little notches on the ""J"" key that I used to use to orient my fingers when I begin typing. It has a notch on the ""F"" and the ""5"" on the tenkeys area, but not on the ""J"".. Instructions: This is where this set really fails. A very thick booklet is included with this set, but don't get excited. Most of the book is translations. There's only about 3-5 pages of instructions, in very small print (I needed to get a magnifier to read them!), and the instructions aren't complete. The instructions could be written with more clarity about how to change colors, and the website for downloading drivers isn't even listed. AND when you do Google-search and find the website, you'll find that the model number on the booklet (and mouse & keyboard) isn't the same as the one on the website. (If you read the Q&A for this item, you'll see what I mean.). Overall, the instructions are the worst problem with this item. If you can get beyond this, it's not a bad set for the price.

8,5.0,"Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the ""you get what you pay for"" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.. The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange ""tall"" type that relocates the ""\"" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.. Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. ""#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?"" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... ""What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return"". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.. TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.",Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo RGB Backlit Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys Wrist Rest and Red Backlit Gaming Mouse 3200 DPI for Windows PC Gamers (Black),0.2153701403266621,0.5053717506326203

0,2.0,"This keyboard and mouse work. They're perfectly serviceable. The light options on the keyboard are nice. That's the extent of the good things I can say about this set, unfortunately.. To start with, the mouse. I thought I was getting a five-button gaming mouse (not including scroll wheel): I did not. The two side buttons are MACRO playback buttons that require Redragon's propriety and obviously-machine-translated software to function. The macro function sucks because it doesn't have good manual editing; you cannot type in a set of instructions to push X button at Y time, etc, etc, the way you could with AutoHotKey. You have to record all the keystrokes in the correct order and manually edit the timing/delete anything. But you cannot add!. You CAN assign the side buttons - and, for that matter, the regular Mouse1 and Mouse2 buttons - to other keys. However, you CANNOT simply assign them to, say, Mouse3 or Mouse4, as those options are anomalously missing. You may only assign it to Left or Right Mouse, or a bunch of special windows keys like IE Forward/Back, Multimedia, Mouse1/Mouse2, Internet Explorer special keys, and the like.. The middle button, below the mousewheel and between the left and right mouse keys, is not a mouse button! ALL it does is swap between one of four programmable mouse input DPI steps. This seems mostly superflous to me, as you can set the mouse's DPI in the software. I wouldn't mind so much if ""switch between DPI settings"" was an OPTION and I could reclaim that button for, say, Mouse5, but nope! That is absolutely, positively ALL it does.. The keyboard has some FANCY light options, I'll give it that. The instruction book is reasonably helpful at explaining them all, too. Annoyingly, they're only a set of input-based options from the keyboard's own function key, and NOT programmable via the software - which has nothing at all to do with the keyboard. Furthermore, the mouse only has one color - red - and you can only choose between light on, light off, and if it is on, change the speed of the mouse light's breathing. These products are obviously not made as partners, they're just two different products manufactured by the same company and sold as a set.. The keyboard, also, feels cheap. See also the damage on the S, D, N, M, and . keys in my picture above. I have only had this keyboard about six months (arrived mid-April 2019, photograph taken mid-September 2019, day before the date-of-posting since midnight has just passed as I am typing this,) and it's already visibly worn from use. This is the kind of keyboard that's made to be unboxed immediately before a PC gaming pro sets down for a tournament, it doesn't feel like it's going to stand up to two decades of wear and still be functional the way my last keyboard was - and still is, though filthy and with many keys worn physically through. I bought this combo for the mouse, which, speaking of cheapness;. The mouse is also bloody cheap, too. It FEELS nice and solid and thunky and heavy in your hand - that's because there's a bloody great mass of sodding metal weights inside it! You can pull them out to adjust their spacing and numbering if you like, so that's nice I guess, but with them all out, if just looks feels like a generic Logitech corded mouse going through a Goth phase.. In conclusion, they work, they're cheap enough and if you like ""gaming"" stuff, or dragons, or black, or colors, or fancy rainbow cycling lights and you need to replace either or both of a keyboard or mouse, they'll do the job. But do not expect a gaming mouse (it is not,) or a gaming keyboard (it has literally no gaming features whatever.)",Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo RGB Backlit Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys Wrist Rest and Red Backlit Gaming Mouse 3200 DPI for Windows PC Gamers (Black),0.13727919589988558,0.5728543487164176
1,4.0,"For, what I'd call, an ""entry level"" set, inexpensive, fairly solid with good feedback on keys and DPI on mouse.. I'll give ReDragon props for flashy. This is one flashy keyboard, the solid backlight setting is great, especially gaming in low-light. I still have attempted the ""changes color with each keystroke"" but would likely be a strobe effect.. Warning: There is no downloadable software, all the settings are manually done at the Keyboard or Mouse. The only reason I can't give it a 5-star. This is why it is a good entry level gaming setup. No macros to program, it would be up to the game to keymap, but macros are out. The DPI setting on the mouse resets each time you shutdown/restart the computer, so you just need to click the DPI selection button. Same goes with the Keyboard, the FN Home, or FN END will change the backlighting. The instructions have a page on which each does.. I'm not a fan of the ""no memory"" aspect of the keyboard and mouse, but the cable length, funcitionality and feel of the keyboard, a well weighted full sized mouse. Oh, cable length is good to longer than expected, I think about 5'. The mouse cable is braided.. It's really not a bad set, I might get one of ReDragon's higher end KB/Mouse over the more ""common"" brands out there.

2,2.0,"Where to begin...well lets start with the good. The keyboard and mouse are quite comfortable. I loved the weight of the mouse. Yep, that's all of the good currently. As for the bad: No software came in the packaging. I had to google the software which took me to a youtube video where I found a link. Problem is that the website you go to doesn't specifically list this combo. Installing the mouse software was smooth. It had all your typical button settings and a macro manager. Problem is that one of the ""programmable buttons"" did not show up in the software. That middle chevron button next to the wheel was not listed. The keyboard software didn't even detect the keyboard, so didn't get a chance to make any adjustments. I tried to get everything to work for an hour before giving up. But here is the really odd thing. I have 3 screen. The mouse pointer stopped at the edge of each screen. Yeah totally odd. I fooled around with various settings and got it to work then rebooted. On reboot, none of my mouse settings were saved, and oddly, two of my monitors were no longer recognized by Win10.

4,3.0,"Although as a kb it's on the 'normal' side (no issues) there are a some (IMO) large 'niggly' points.. First, no configuration (software) for the kb. This means every time you shutdown/reboot all your 'settings' revert to default. so you have to change the settings back to the way you want, EVERY TIME you restart/reboot your system, this equals a PITA.. Secondly, ergonomically, the foot rests when fully extended only change the inclination of the kb by about 5% and don't make it any easier to use, especially for those of us who can touch type. The higher the inclination, the less 'reaching' you have to do to get the 'top row' keys (numbers, etc) and you can forget trying to reach the function key row completely.. For the money spent you can get a better 'combo' than this with better configuration setup and better 'ergonomics' than this kb..

7,5.0,"I use my keyboard anywhere from 8-16 hours a day most days. I work in a dimly lit room at night and need a backlit keyboard that I can see, but doesn't blind me, and that will last. Others I've had in the past had painted keycaps that would wear off within 6 months to a year. I purchased a different brand before I bought this one, then gave the other one away because the backlight wouldn't stay on due to an unadvertised ""auto-off"" feature that could not be disabled.. This keybaord is perfect for me. I love the backlight. There are several modes, but I always set it to a single color and choose my preferred brightness. It's bright enough without being obnoxious, but it can be turned up to be very bright if you wish. The keys are average height, they are fairly quiet; they do make noise, but it's not the super loud clacky noise that some keyboards make. The media buttons work well, but are unobtrusive and require no extra drivers or software.. I love this keyboard, and my only nitpick is one of style: Many keys have an alternate function via the function key. The symbol representing the alternate function is printed at the BOTTOM of each key, meaning the primary function of these keys is printed at the top of the keys. Due to the angle at which you see the keyboard (since it's in front of you) the bottom half othe keys are better lit than the top of the keys, so the alternate functions show up better than the primary functions of the keys. For example, on the arrow keys, the alternate functions for backlight brightness are perfectly backlit, while the arrows themselves are dim. While this is a minor nitpick, I would prefer to have hte primary function on the bottom of the keys with the alternate function printed above..

8,1.0,"I wasn't expecting much for $30 but this keyboard exceeded all expections for me. Firstly, I didn't realize how horribly laggy and imprecise my wireless keyboard and mouse were. The one game i play on my PC was completely transformed as I discovered it was my horrible wireless devices that made me a bad player. LOL. Secondly, once you figure out how to disable the silly flashing rainbow default lighting setup, you have a brilliant backlit keyboard with a complete range of colors and lighting schemes to use in different lighting environments. Finally, those that miss the old mechanical IBM keyboards, this $30 keyboard comes surprisingly close to replicating a good amount of the mechanical feel I miss so much from them. And you don't have to pay close to $200 to get some of that back. The Keyboard layout is largely the classic IBM layout as well. The quibbles I have are minor considering this is a $30 backlit keyboard and 3,600 dpi gaming mouse. 1) The top half of the symbols above the number keys are dimly lit. Not a huge issue but annoying. 2) The keyboard keys are very light to the touch which some people might like. I miss the old heft and sturdiness of the old IBM mechanical keyboard keys. But hey, for $30.... 3) Some silly graphics and lighting on the mouse but then again, only $30..... I would highly recommend this to anyone getting fed up with their wireless chiclet keyboard and glitchy wireless mouse. It's also a cheap test of a 3,600 dpi gaming mouse and keyboard to see if there really is a difference between standard keyboards and mice and gaming dedicated hardware.

0,5.0,"They keyboard is easy to type on. The color choices are great (7 colors), and nice to have extra options like rainbow, pulse, etc. I just put mine on solid white because I'm boring, but my kids like the other settings. By the way, other reviewers might say you can't do this... but you can. Just press Fn+Home repeatedly to select your solid color, and if it's ""breathing"" press Fn+End to turn off the breathing feature.. The mouse is GREAT! Very smooth, and I didn't realize how much I needed a DPI button until I got one! This is the first time I've had a mouse where you can select the sensitivity right there on the mouse! Awesome!. The weights are superfluous for me... I just left them in. I tried taking them out to see if I noticed a difference, and it does become noticeably lighter, but I'd rather just keep them in there so I don't lose them, and so the mouse doesn't fall off the keyboard tray by being pulled by the cord.. All mouse buttons work with Windows 10 without installing anything, which is very nice. Right and left buttons work as normal, wheel scrolls up/down and if you click the wheel it pops up an auto-scroll feature which I am also very much enjoying. The two thumb buttons do page forward/back in browsers (not sure what they do in other apps). Overall I use all the buttons, and they have made me more productive (I bought the set so I could work at night without keeping the light on). Note that the wheel does NOT lean side-to-side. Would be nice if it did, but certainly not a big deal for me (normally this behavior would invoke a horizontal scrolling function).. Also I noticed that some reviewers find the underlining on the keys to be annoying since not all the keys have underlines on them. I believe this is to indicate which keys are ""non-conflict"" keys. It says in the manual that you can press up to 19 of these non-conflict keys at the same time and they will all operate normally. This doesn't make sense from a business perspective (who needs to type two letters at the same time?) but when gaming it makes a HUGE difference. Gamers will use WASD to move their character around, space to jump, and nearby keys to do other things like cast spells, fire weapons, select things, etc. So it is very common to be pressing 3, 4, or 5 of these keys at the same time, and if you're really good you can press even more (each finger can press 2 or 3 keys at the same time by pressing between the keys, and you can even use your palm to press Ctrl). Another bonus for gamers is the ability to disable the windows key (aka the Windows key of sadness, since accidentally pressing it while in a game will immediately make you lose control of the game).. Overall I am VERY happy with the keyboard and mouse. The only suggestion I have for the vendor (that isn't mentioned above already) is that it would be nice to have dedicated volume keys that don't require the use of the Fn key. You can do vol-/+ by pressing Fn+F2/F3, but it's impossible to do that combination with one hand (they are too far apart), and hard to do without looking at the keyboard. There are 10 specialty keys on this keyboard, and I will probably never use any of them... so it's a bit disappointing that the dedicated volume keys are missing, because I would absolutely use them if they were there. I mean come on, F5 already does a refresh by itself, why do you need another dedicated key to do the same thing? Not a big deal, just a minor annoyance, and certainly not even worth dinging a star for.",Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo RGB Backlit Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys Wrist Rest and Red Backlit Gaming Mouse 3200 DPI for Windows PC Gamers (Black),0.10247209821428573,0.5320715525793651

2,5.0,"Quality is about what you would expect for a $15 keyboard and $10 mouse, but with the added features of backlighting and macro/dpi for the mouse. Not really ""gaming"" quality, although the software does offer macro creation (see walkthrough below for software use).. Keyboard:. This is a tall button, ANSI format keyboard with double function F-keys (volume, play, email, etc). The tall keys can be bothersome if you're a writer, but the feedback is good and they are fairly quiet. I can type next to my sleeping toddler without waking her up. The lighting function controls were easy enough to figure out and has rainbow, rainbow shift, steady solid color, and solid color breath settings (and off). Color control is done with Function+Ins,Del,Home,End,PgUp,PgDw. Mouse:. Red color breath or off settings. You can adjust the breath speed and on/off with the software. Mouse click is audible, but not super loud like some cheap junk mice. Button clicks are a little sensitive so if you rest your hand on the mouse you might find yourself clicking them on accident. DPI function works fine out the gate, can be further adjusted with software. Side button assignments require the software to change.. for software go to the redragonusa site, downloads section.. Use the M601 driver (you can tell by the picture). It's a .rar file so if you can't access it you will need something like 7zip (freeware). Once you install that everything is self explantatory except the macro creation. You can find how to videos if you search it.. Basically, go to Macro Manager section > Create new > click the ""Record"" button in the bottom right > Type in your macro (ie Ctrl+C ) > Click Record again to stop > Go to Button Assign section > select Macro from the left drop down box > select your macro in the right drop down..

4,3.0,"The keyboard is fine, but the mouse is underwhelming, and I'll explain why.. First off, when I went to look for the program to configure the mouse, it falls under S601 now, not S101 as it is stated. That caused a bit of confusion.. Secondly; the DPI toggle is one button. Most gaming mice have 2 buttons to toggle the DPI up and down on the fly. With a 1 button setup, if I am on Setting 2 (1200 DPI) and want to switch to Setting 1 (600 DPI), I cannot toggle UP. I have to go through Settings 3, 4, & 5, and THEN back to 1.. That's pretty bad, given that gaming in fist-person shooters is frequently done with a high DPI to look around, then a low DPI to precisely aim. With my old, $20 mouse, I could toggle up and down. With this mouse, I have to frantically mash the DPI toggle to get back to a lower setting.. Secondly: Other programmable mouse I have had frequently have different colors for different DPI settings.. This mouse has one tiny strip-light that flashes at different speeds, just below the toggle button...In the center of the mouse...Where your hand will be covering it. If you look in the picture, the DPI toggle button looks like a chevron/ arrow pointing down at the light that flashes.. Just two horrible design choices that make the mouse pretty lousy for gaming..

6,5.0,"I was looking for a lighted keyboard to put on my home theater PC, that I've found I am gaming on that big screen here more lately. I was just using an old basic HP keyboard I had laying around, but given I use this in the dark it was of course impossible to see the keys with just the light from the screen.. On my main desktop I have a Razer Black Widow, and I love it, so I have something to compare this one to. I didn't want to spend that much on a keyboard for the home theater PC, but still wanted the backlight.. I ended up buying this one based solely on the Amazon ratings, and quite frankly, I didn't have very high expectations. I figured it was Amazon, and if the keyboard was total crap, I could return it anyway. Boy, was I surprised when it arrived!. For a keyboard at this price point, I was very happy to see if felt like, while very lightweight, decent construction. Amazon shipped it in it's bare box with no outer box, and of course the box was all dinged up from shipping, and I expected it to be broken, but it was just fine.. Even more surprising were my first impressions of the mouse. Just the feel of it, it felt like a much more expensive mouse, and having a braided cable at this price point is fantastic. I wasn't even expecting to use the mouse, as I have a trackball, I mostly just bought this for the keyboard.. I haven't tried the mouse in actual use yet, probably going to give it to a friend, but the keyboard suites my needs very nicely. The adjustments of the RGB LEDs are easy to do right on the keyboard. They key feel of course is softer than the Razer I am used to on my desktop, but I was happy to learn that this brand has a higher end keyboard available with those type of keys, I might purchase in the future..

It does take a while to learn which key functions to use to get it to where you may want it, but it is a very easy instruction manual. Since I am not using this for gaming I will say I am really glad that I did read the reviews and purchase this. I did have an issue with one of the keys sticking, but when I contacted the seller they responded immediately and were ever so happy without question to replace it. I contacted Amazon and after scanning my return had my replacement keyboard sent out the same day and received it the following day.

8,4.0,"I guess I got my money's worth. The default setting for this keyboard and mouse is to come up blinking all colors. . And every time you turn on your computer, you have to select a color scheme or work on a blinking keyboard. Also, sometimes, the caps-lock light goes out of sync between keyboard and computer. Specially when using a remote desktop app. Very strange. Finally, I've noticed that if I step away from my computer for a while (1 or 2 hours), I'm very likely to come back to an unresponsive keyboard. It looses contact with the PC. I have to restart my computer. I have no proof that the keyboard is causing this. These things don't occur a lot (except the blinking). But ..

REVIEW. I felt a need to post the above controls because the first thing I did when I got this keyboard / mouse was to remove it from the box and plug it straight into the computer. I was WRONG about:. - This keyboard (S101-3) DOES NOT have supported software.. - The lighting controls are done from the keyboard itself.. SO when I plugged this keyboard and immediately the keyboard started streaming colors across the keys...WHAT IS GOING ON. This should NOT be the default. Anyways, I looked online for software, but there is none. Then I tried to use the lighting controls on the keyboard and could not figure it out. I had to pull out the manual (see pictures) and I'm copying it here for reference. Hopefully this helps you like it helped me.. So there IS a way to choose solid colors. And there IS a way to cycle through colors WITHOUT breathing (which I prefer).. Cons:. - No software. - Confusing when first using.. Pros:. - QUIET. I know this is a mesh keyboard, but man is this so much quieter than my mechanical keyboard.. - LOTS of buttons. I kinda geek out a little about all the options to control things from the push of a button right from the keyboard and this has lots of that.. So even though I just started using this I think it will grow on me. Maybe I'll come back and update my review later and give it an extra star if all else is well.

In other words, you will not easily be able to replace a key membrane with another one.. - The mouse is good.

As an avid gamer who spends most of her free time typing, gaming and on the computer in general I'm thoroughly impressed. The keys are soft to the touch, silent and responsive. The lighting is good, if you type in the dark it's really helpful! The colors can be changed to be crazy RGB running all over, or a soft neutral color (i picked white) as the backlight. Fully adjustable.. The only negative I have is the mouse. I wasn't intending to buy a mouse but figured I'd try it. I'm a fairly small girl with small hands but this mouse is pretty small for even me. Not unusable but I definitely prefer the larger mice that are a little more comfortable on the hand.

2,5.0,So I'll be honest this is my first gaming mouse and keyboard. I saw it was an Amazon Choice and was $39 for the pair and they had RGB. So I'm thinking well I'll give it a try. Even though it's only three weeks till Christmas I still got my keyboard with 3-4 days was of course very easy to set up just plug in and it's ready no need to do anything on your computer. I had to read the manual just to figure out how to set color on the keyboard which was very easy. The keyboard itself is very nice and quiet soft keys very bright. The mouse as well very bright the cable on the mouse is nice because it's red and black which matches my computer table. This is not one of those really big mouse I'd say average size the RGB is very nice and bright as well just remember to take of the sticker peel on the bottom otherwise the mouse moves slow.

3,4.0,"Initial findings.. I love the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù brushed coating on the keyboard it feels nice and over all is very comfortable ergonomically when typing. The keys have good resistance, footprint and travel. They feel like I‚Äôm actually hitting keys vs buttons like some smaller keyboards.. The lighting effects are fun with a wide range of settings and can turn them off or dim them as needed with a couple keystrokes. Over all a solid buy for the cost.. As for the mouse, while not the main reason I bought this setup, it seems like a mild afterthought. The plastic is hard and stiff making it feel like it wasn‚Äôt finished, the components like buttons, edging and grips are uneven making it feel like it was put together wrong, the weight and over all feel reminds me of a cheap generic stock mouse you would find in a computer lab or office that came with the dell still running windows 7, that‚Äôs made to barely serve a purpose. and nothing more. The finish is textured to give a better grip, but unlike the soft almost silicon texture of the keyboard, the surface feels hard and abrasive. Even the ‚Äúsilicon‚Äù grips feel like hard plastic.. I do appreciate the sensitivity toggle option for the curser. Having duel screens and a higher sensitivity is amazingly helpful. But every time the computer is put to sleep or turned off cutting power to the mouse the setting goes back to the low sensitivity default so every time I have to reset it.. Finally my biggest complaint and the reason for the 4 star review is the mouse is so loud and clicky I cant use the mouse with any open mics because it will wash out any other sound coming through.. Over all if you just need a solid keyboard or need a mouse and keyboard combo for general use. Not a bad option.

I unplugged and than plugged it in again, and it solved the problem. About a week later I moved the keyboard a little and it started cycling through music tracks again, but I was not even playing music at the time. I did same thing unplugged and plugged in.

For the price it's not bad, but the fact that you can't select a single color and brightness for the backlighting to stay at is a great annoyance and makes the keyboard rather unusable long term in my opinion.

I got tired of my wireless keyboard and mouse because it started causing some typing delays, it was getting annoying. My husband plays on the computer but has not tried this set yet. He thought it was pretty ""fancy"" after I set it up today. I like that the keyboard doesn't sound like my old one with the clickity-clack, the mouse makes the same clickity sound though, but it's more tolerable than my old one.. Light: I like how there are options for the lights. I don't like the breathing different colors as I find it too distracting. So, I'm glad that it gives the option of just setting it to one color light, and one setting of light mode - which I prefer to be just on. The mouse doesn't seem to have that option? It's only red color, and breathing mode.. Ergonomics: I love how it's ergonomic. It helps my hands and wrists a lot. Compared to my older one that was just flat (both keyboard and mouse), on this keyboard I can comfortably rest the bottom of my palm on the bottom of this keyboard, and the mouse is shaped to make your hand rest comfortably.. If you look at my pictures, you can see that I took of the thing at the bottom of the mouse. I don't know what it is, but I think it's to make the mouse heavier? I thought at first hey were batteries, but I looked closer and they're not. This is probably for a gamer thing.. Overall I'm just glad that this came in with no issues.

7,4.0,"This is a normal keyboard. I bought in anticipation of replacing another keyboard that was giving me problems. About 30 days later my old keyboard, was having a problem with a few keys including the return key and I was happy to have this keyboard ready. I thought it would have some ergonomic qualities. It has little legs you can set up to change the angle of the keyboard and that is about the extent of its ergonomic characteristics. The keys are super smooth, so they are a little slippery for me. My hands are a little on the dry side. I bought this keyboard, because I thought it was a good deal for an ergonomic keyboard and did not really pay too much attention to the gaming aspect of it. It has flashing lights that are kind of annoying, but if you read the instruction manual you can adjust them to a single color, flashing and non-flashing or no light at all. It is very hard to see without a light, though. Not sure how it will work at night, but I think it will work nicely and in that regard I think it offers something not on my previous keyboard. In daytime hours it is hard to see the keys, as the characters are not painted on, but are rather are see through . I would not recommend for anyone looking for an ergonomic keyboard. At first I was unhappy with it, but once I figured how to adjust the lights I am okay with it and are actually happy I can use it at night without additional lighting. The fact that it came with a mouse is an additional bonus, so yeah I would buy again for the price, but I think if I could fight an ergonomic keyboard for the same price I would buy ergonomic.",Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo RGB Backlit Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys Wrist Rest and Red Backlit Gaming Mouse 3200 DPI for Windows PC Gamers (Black),0.07641369047619045,0.5403335813492063
8,4.0,"This is a good backlit keyboard for the price, but the included mouse is a painful nightmare. The keyboard has several colors, pattern options, and brightness level that let you choose between something flashy or less distracting. Letters, numbers, and symbols are large and easy to see clearly when illuminated. Keys are a good large size and very comfortable to type on for a long time, without being loud enough to bother other people a few feet away. The biggest downside is that the keys are too dark to read with the backlight off, so you will always need the backlight on to use it. There is also a very bright red LED for the Num Lock indicator that you may want cover with a piece of black tape. Overall, though it is a good backlit keyboard for all day typing and better than expected for $40-$50.. The included mouse, however, is small and anyone with larger than average hands will have to be clutching it wiht your whole hand tightly wrapped around it. The mouse also doesn't slide easily on a mousepad so you must also hold it tighter and push harder to move, which made my hand and wrist ache almost immediately.

The mouse however is very plastic feeling. Would say for a cheap set the keyboard is fine but the mouse leaves a lot to be desired.. The RGB on the keyboard is poor. I have some very high end mech rgb keyboards and those flow like water. This keyboard more of flashes. The issue I see is the color is broken up into zones, aka 3 or 4 rows of keys meaning there's a jerky flow to its movement. Honestly, I think they'd of been better off just making the keyboard sold colors.. The mouse led is stuck at red. Personally not a fan of black and red in 2019 (2013 called, they want their gaming colors back). Though my largest issue with the led on the mouse is it breaths and I can't figure out how to make it a solid color.. Overall I'd say this is a cheap, budget keyboard + mouse set and it looks and feels like that. I'd highly suggest anyone looking for a kb&m save up until they get a proper mech keyboard and mouse.

5,5.0,"OK, I'm late to the party. I'm a 42 year old engineer who has been playing computer games since Lemonade Stand on my Apple II+. I remember thinking Zork was awesome. For those who don't know, neither of those games actually had graphics.... So, when I started hearing about Minecraft I thought, ""Huh?"" I piddled with it a little and it was this clunky looking Java based game and I couldn't really understand the appeal it. I derided it as a jumbled up, incoherent mess, and I wasn't really wrong, but... I hate being wrong. My son started getting older. We bought Minecraft on the PC. We bought Pocket Edition on his Kindle Fire. I installed a private server for him and his friends on our Synology Rackstation (see my blog page about how to to do that). I even played a little while testing those things. Still: meh.. Somehow about 3 months ago my son, now almost 9, sucked me in. Geez. We're now on our ""Mark II"" Pocket Edition survival world sharing between his Kindle Fire and my Windows 10 Beta version, and we have a system of rails, lava motes, redstone equipment (omigosh, I'm tediously creating digital systems!?!) and I'm completely hooked.... So, I stepped up and bought a 2nd PC copy because the Pocket Edition doesn't quite cut it, and I want to play on our server.. The digital purchase on Amazon works as expected. No complaints. The price is the same as elsewhere but if you have a reason to buy things on Amazon then buying here makes sense.. As for the game, it's still a bit of a mess, but it's a fun mess, and no, the graphics aren't complicated, but we've gotten too obsessed with graphics and forgotten about gameplay. Zork is still awesome. So is Minecraft.. Note: The full ""PC"" (Java) version of Minecraft includes a free copy of the Windows 10 Edition.

6,5.0,"Disclaimer: This particular purchase wasn‚Äôt for myself, but I do own the game.. I‚Äôm sure everyone‚Äôs heard most of this before, but Minecraft is currently one of the most popular games in the world, despite looking like it was made in the late 1980s. The freedom to do literally whatever you want to the world, the modification (modding) potential (and the truly epic modifications [mods] that already exist), the *creative* potential...It‚Äôs an incredible game.. <insert preferred deity here> knows how many copycat games have been created; as we all know, imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so that should tell you a lot. The game is deceptively simple at its core, but you can get some of the aforementioned mods if you want to add complexity.. On the subject of game mods, the old iPhone-app joke of ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an app for that‚Äù applies to Minecraft as well, in that ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a mod for that.‚Äù Want to build a massive functional industrial complex that processes all your mining yields for you? There‚Äôs a mod (ok, several dozen mods) for that. Would you rather explore the arcane mysteries of the world and bend reality itself to your will? There‚Äôs a mod (ok fine yes there‚Äôs more than one, although not as many as there are industrial mods) for that. More options for creative building? Mod. More powerful building tools? Mod.. Minecraft started out as a simple browser-based Java applet that, although it did gain *some* popularity, wasn‚Äôt widely known. When the company announced their plan to make a more complex standalone game, the current playerbase did spread the word, and it gained quite a bit of traction; in fact, I myself preordered the game practically the moment it was available for preorder (I then promptly forgot all about it until I got the official release notification ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and have been thoroughly enjoying the game.. A bit of advice to the flock of potential new players: There are *two different editions* of Minecraft: Java edition, which is the original game, is only playable on PCs (including iOS and Linux, unless I‚Äôm mistaken), and is as of the writing of this review the only edition that properly supports modding, and Bedrock edition, which is a relatively recent unification of all the console and mobile versions, which were previously individual editions (i.e. XB360 edition, PS3 edition, mobile edition, etc.), but currently does not support modding of the kind we see in the Java edition. Mojang (the developer) *has* been working hard on adding that kind of modding to Bedrock edition, so before too much longer that distinction will no longer exist, but it is my belief that most of the ‚Äúbig name‚Äù mods (ones that have been around since the early days) will most likely not switch entirely to Bedrock edition, and some of the biggest probably won‚Äôt want to tackle the added workload of literally (no joke) rewriting their mod completely from scratch as Bedrock edition does not use the same coding language as Java edition.. This product card will get you your very own Java edition, meaning you can mod to your heart‚Äôs content. I‚Äôm just one person, but I strongly believe that if you‚Äôre into open-world sandbox games, you‚Äôll love Minecraft.",Minecraft: Java Edition for PC/Mac [Online Game Code],0.16687645687645683,0.5275562400562398

Mojang's website is an utter garbage heap and has been for the last 10 years. It's like the web circa 1999, where it technically CAN work, but you have to figure out the correct path first. This is part of what led me to Amazon to purchase: Mojang directly led me off their site to somewhere else to buy the code to put on their site. Brilliant.. Amazon's code, when pasted directly into Mojang's ""redeem code"", doesn't work because there is an extra space at the end. Also, the page that leads you off of Mojang's site has a ""redeem code"" area, but it's fake. Don't bother trying to use it.

There are still plenty of people playing Battlefield 4 that one can easily find servers with enough players to fill matches. At ~$4, purchasing this game is a no brainer.. The game runs pretty well, especially on modern computers with adequate specs. Most if not all of the bugs and shortcomings this game had in the beginning have all been fixed for the most part. And with all of the content like maps, weapons, tools now available make for a great experience.. One of the only downsides I am mildy annoyed with is that the game requires players to utilize a separate launcher to play the game. This means that on top of having to also use EA's launcher service Origin, one also needs to use a seperate launcher known as Battlelog. It's a slight inconvenience at best, and an annoyance that takes up a bit more of a computer's resources at worse when playing Battlefield 4. Games like Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, and Battlefield 1 all need Battlelog to be able to play.

0,5.0,"I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.. Pros:. Price for the quality is great. Decent speaker/mic sound. Good quality cable that is at least 6' long. Sits comfortably on the head. Stereo/mic to separate stereo and mic connector included. In-line mic mute switch and audio volume adjustment. Cons:. The USB is only a power source for the blue lights on the headset (it is a bit misleading in its uses, but if I had researched it a bit more I would have found this out before purchase). The in-line mute and volume knob would be better with a mic gain knob as well. It tends to make my head a bit sweaty (I have long hair and live in South Texas, US. So it is hard to find headsets that don't do that, but still something to keep in mind). The headset only goes on one way (The traditional right and left side is enforced by the mic only being usable one way. I know I am in the minority, but I like the mic being on the right side of my head). So this is absolutely worth the money, but if you are looking for a high-end headset this is not it. I know my cons were a bit nit picky, and I don't want anyone to think that I regret this purchase. I knew I was getting a quick solution to needing a headset, and I honestly got more than I was looking for. The USB lighting, while completely useless, is a cool addition. The only reason it didn't make it into the pros section is because unless you want to look cool on stream it is wasted resources.. So, yea. If you want a good quality headset for a good price this is great for you.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.21355664660542706,0.5033570900644072
1,5.0,"This headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable. Microphone works good as well. Lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice.. Only complaint is that this headset is meant for PC users given the fact that both the USB cable and microphone plug in are connected very close together to the cable. Meaning, that if you are playing on PS4 you plug the microphone cable into the controller but can't plug the USB cable into the system for the lights. I ended up buying a 3 foot USB extension cable in order to be able to use the lights. So if you are using anything other than a PC and want the lights on the headset while you play, then you'll need an USB extension cable.. This product is very good though.

2,4.0,"I'll start off by saying I'm a middle aged dad who purchased this for my teenage son so that he would stop borrowing his sister's Beats for gaming. I was first expecting to pay $100, but was pleasantly surprised by the pricing and reviews for these.. I just now tested these, and to me, they don't seem too bad. The audio quality is lesser than the Beats he was using, but to me, that's OK. They are not as comfortable as the Beats either, but they're still fine for wearing for hours on end.. Unfortunately, they were not acceptable for my teenage son. This was just one gift of the many for his birthday. We tend to go overboard, even before Christmas. He wasn't overly thrilled, but used them immediately. Later, in a fit of rage over his other gifts, he shouts ""Thanks for the $10 scratchy headset Dad!"".. So, if you're a middle age person looking for good value, I think these are a good fit.

Doesn't last long and sounds like crap. He actually looked around here on Amazon and settled for this one, I didn't question him because well it's for him and the price was not bad. He really wanted another one but said it was too expensive. When I received it, he immediately started using it, right in the car with his tablet. The first thing that surprised me was how light it was. It is really light but it is not flimsy. It is not very hard and unyielding but it is sturdy enough. What I liked also liked was the quality of the cord. It is thicker than I thought it would be and the ends came covered with a plastic cover. The USB part is to power up the LEDs on the headphone. It doesn't affect the performance in any way, it can be used without it. He talked to his friends online and he says they said the quality is very good. The sound is what he likes also. He says the bass is not too loud and 'drowning', it is just right for him. I tried it myself to play a game and I was impressed. I am very finicky when it comes to quality of music and sound effects and so on, so when I say I was impressed, that is not to be taken lightly.

The mic is clear and the base for the video games is also a nice surprise for the price.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.2912087912087912,0.6341575091575091
7,1.0,This headset started off ok but then kept cutting in and out and now has stopped working completely after one month for our xbox one and when it did work others kept complaining there was echoing and hard to hear. Wish I never spent any money on this and now cant even return. Tried it on 3 different controllers. Really am baffled why it has over 10.000 reviews and such a high rating.

8,5.0,"This headset (I bought three) fits my adult head good. It also fits my six year old head comfortably according to him, and the third set is from my eight year old grandson. He says that it fits him nicely as well. The sound quality is very good. I noticed many new sounds from video games I had never heard before once I began wearing these. The kids can communicate through party chat across town with no issues. These were a great buy and I would definitely recommend BENGOO to anyone looking for a headset for an XBOX ONE.. And... The customer service from this seller is great. I got a second email asking for my opinions after several weeks of ownership. They simply wanted to know if I was happy with the product and if not, how could they make it right. 5 stars from me for the extra mile.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.33160389610389607,0.46137012987012993

I was happy with the sound quality and production value of the headphones; however the set I received was very tight against my ears causing them to hurt after only an hour our two. I posted a review of my experience and a BENGOO representative reached out to me. They sent a brand new pair at no additional expense and I am very happy with my new set. They fit properly and are very comfortable.. They have great dynamic sound. I primarily use these for online gaming and am able to clearly identify if sneaking up behind me.

It works GREAT on my Xbox one and only issues I had was with the longevity but that is not an issue anymore. The customer service was AMAZING and very speedy in helping me resolve my issue.. Older Review: Lasted for seven months then left ear with mic started malfunctioning. I took great care of headset with hanging it up and not dropping it. While this headset lasted, it was a great headset. Great volume, the mic was able to be moved vertically up and down, no static, and the cord was very lengthy. The mic sometimes caused an echo in the Xbox party, but can be avoided by adjusting Xbox headset volume settings. But other than that it was a great headset for the price. I rated this mic three stars because of its longevity but other than that it was a good affordable headset.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.3617283950617284,0.583179012345679
0,5.0,"$26 Look at ALL those reviews and stellar rating. Their true. Yeah, they're plastic so be responsible and don't treat them petulantly. DO NOT throw them in gaming frustration. Side effects=if you play CoD and use ALL SOUNDS feature (not just mic only for team) the experience is intense. My friend dropped more F-bombs in one hour than i've heard him say in 10 years bc it's a whole new thrilling experience. Personally, i started feeling 'carsick' when watching him play with no sound coming from TV-idk-i hadn't played in months tho. ps im trying to be humorous not cautionary Enjoy -edit- whoah Look at the plethora of 1 star ratings after Holyday! i will honestly update in near future should problems arrive. in the meantime grab my Soapbox. REALLY?!? Can that many headsets be bad? i see a pattern and it smells funny too. im sorry but i know how children behave during Holyday break. i reiterate my earliest points about personal responsibility. these headsets arrive on Safe Mode so you don't blow your eardrums. You MUST go into System Settings and adjust Mic settings and Volume settings like a diagnostic. when you find it, it's really quite awesome. the mic is so sweet you don't even need to pull it down like a TV broadcaster. you can leave it up in safer upright position and adjust settings to those specs. This many headsets cannot be faulty--maybe it's the reckless, impatient, temper tantrum in the room next door with too long a Holyday break that is to blame. Stop bad-mouthing Bengoo for an acceptable, affordable option to all the overpriced/expensive headsets that you undoubtedly would be moaning about too had you purchased them. You ain't getting your money back so stop complaining/begging and accept some personal responsibility.

1,1.0,"My son used this headset for gaming and listening to music for two years. He always thought the sound wasn't great. Now I know why:. The cable got nicked at the jack with use. Being an electronics guy, I wanted to replace the jack rather than trash the entire headset. Big surprise when I exposed the wires and found only three going to the jack. (And yes, I went farther and farther back to find the elusive 4th wire. Not there!). With only three wires it is physically impossible to have stereo. One is the common wire, one is for the microphone, and the third is for the speakers - which means there is no differentiation between left and right!","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.04920634920634922,0.4925595238095238

4,1.0,"I have been gaming for 25 years. I bought these for my son. These are the worst designed headphones I have ever seen. In order for it to light up you must plug it into a usb port, but in order for you to hear audio you need to plug another cord in the audio jack. That's all fine if you have a set up with both ports 1 inch apart from eachother but if you intend to use them on a playstation, xbox, or nintendo switch the you can forget having them light up. Instead you will just have an extra cord dangling all over your hands which is very irritating. The microphone also is not adjustable and we have yet to actually get it to work regardless of gaming system. Lastly, they just are not comfortable. Trash. I would compare these to a 10 dollar set of headphones from a dollar general. Honestly, the dollar general headphones my son had before were better. I don't care what the reviews say. These are terrible. They afe probably ok and only ok if you use them on a computer where the ports are inherently close.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.04098039215686275,0.6098039215686275
5,1.0,"The sound quality is ""ok"", and by that I mean there is some surround sound, left/right, but not so much full directional, and that's pretty important to know.. Teammates said mic sounded ok. Downside is the mic is short and stiff, maybe that will protect it better? The mic is adequate and good for the price.. Now for the meat of this review... THE EAR COVERS ARE STIFF AND TINY. They wrap around my 3 year olds ears great, not mine though! It's actually PAINFUL to wear these longer than 30 minutes, so don't plan to game long with these. If you have tiny ears, or are under 10 years old, then these are for you. Of you're an adult, move on.. I ended up spending 3X more for a Razer Kraken headset and omg let me tell you, for 3X the price I think I got 10X the value. The sound quality of the Razer headset is just miles ahead of these garbage bengoos. You try these trashy bengoos and then try some razer krakens with 7.1 surround and you will blow your mind of the quality difference. Not just in sound quality, but also in build quality, the mic, the comfort of the ear muffs, just wow, I would have paid 10X the price difference if I knew beforehand how big a difference there is between trashy cheap bengoos and actual good quality headsets like Razer... Never going back from Razer, I'll buy them again and again for life now that I know.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.19813748079877114,0.5006720430107526

So, looking at all the options I thought I had to purchase a $100+ headset just to get the effect I was looking for.. However, when I stumbled on this product I was taken back by how too good it sounds. For the price it was offering it seemed too good to be true, but even with my doubts I went ahead and ordered. And thank god I did, because this was probably one of the best gaming purchases I've ever made..

7,5.0,"This headset is one of the best I have ever purchased. While I liked the pink I purchased in blue because the price difference simply wasn't worth it to me to have a different color. The price is great and they look nice. There is padding under the part that rests on top of your head which is super comfortable and the headband is adjustable. They are noise canceling and sound quality is excellent. When u have them turned up I can not hear anything around me which is perfect for serious gamers so that you can focus on gameplay. I am a call of duty gamer on PS4 and the headset takes the game to a whole different level because you can actually hear individual noises from left or right and good bass quality. There is a switch on the cord to adjust volume and turn on and off the mic. Mic quality is awesome no buzzing, humming or crackling. The only thing I am confused about is the light up part. There is a headphone jack and a USB port at the bottom of the cord. The headset only lights up when you have the USB port plugged in but for PS4 to have the headset plugged into the controller you can not plug the USB into the PS4 without being directly ontop of the console which leaves you no room to move the controller while playing because the cord is split at the bottom for the different plug instead and it's not spread out enough to have the length to have both plugged in. It's not a deal breaker for me but maybe because of the design the light up aspect is better for PC gamers. The light up detail is nice but not necessary to game obviously. All in all the headset is perfect and super sturdy and comfortable. Best one I have ever bought and works perfect for cod on ps4. I definetly recommend to gamers but like I said before just keep in mind that it may be hard for you to use it and also use the light up feature if you are using PS4, Xbox etc. Overall it is awesome, cheapest headset I've ever bought and definetly best quality.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.3115476190476191,0.5976904761904762

9,3.0,"These headphones are equipped with a thick in the middle of them which rests on the middle of your head. Which is nice to avoid head pain and vibrations. The ear pieces are large and can fit anyone's face which is nice!.. The colors are bright and not dull in the least bit.. The cord is braided and stripped with blue and black. The overall build is slightly bulky and the headphones are not made of the best durable plastic. If you are buying these for someone who rages a lot playing games, these will break. If you take care of them, they CAN last for a bit. The sound is basic, it does what it needs to. It is certainly not noise cancelling, I can hear others in the next room when playing games or listening to music. However, the noises are certainly dulled, which is okay. There are lots of options to plug this headset into pc, laptop, console, and controllers which is amazing.. These are not wireless headphones, and the wires on this headset are LONG. There is an audio control box on the wire itself that has the volume control on it. There is a button directly on the top of the box that is a fake plastic button (most likely there for aesthetics), and then there is the actually scroll dial on the side of the box. I wish the button on the top was actually useable, but you win some, you lose some.. In short, these are nice for the budget savvy shopper. If you want your teen kids to still hear you while they play games, these are a decent option for you. The headphone paddings decent, its foam, cant go wrong with foam really, so the headphone are relatively comfortable.. Mind you, I stated ""teen kids"" I said this because of the size of these headphones. These are not meant for kids younger than at least 12 -13 years old..

The lights glow as described by the seller, the microphone works very well. The lights have the separate USB cable connection alongside 3,5 mm jack connection to connect to the USB port in your computer. The Headphones‚Äô USB cable needs to be connected to the Computer for the lights to work. This gaming set is mostly based for PC gaming.. XBOX ONE CONSOLE. When connected to xbox one controller and adjusted to maximum volume , the sound is not too loud or too quiet, but just right. The lights do not glow, the microphone works just as good as it does on a PC. The reason the lights do not work on xbox one controller, it is because there is no USB connection for it. The headphones will still work, but the lights won‚Äôt. Your not going to connect the headphones to a console thats 12 feet away from your bed for the lights to work of course.. Sound Cancellation:.

3,2.0,"For the price, these certainly do the job. The audio quality is surprisingly adequate. While the headphones themselves do not have active noise canceling, they block sound a little bit. The microphone, however, seems to cancel noise. I couldn't hear any background noise in my tests. The included splitter for mic/audio is a nice touch, as I needed to use this feature. Do not mistake the USB connector for being a USB audio connector. It is only for the lights on the headset. The construction is a little flimsy but that is to be expected from a headset this hefty at this price. The pad at the top feels nice and is better than most. The cord that comes with it is braided, has a velcro strap for organization and a nice mic mute and volume control. If you don't want to spend twice the money, these are the way to go.. Edit: These hurt my ears very badly after more than 1 or 2 hours of use. It helps if I place them in front of my ears, but this is not a natural placement and feels like they might fall off. When my ear is inside the headphones, they press against the hard inside and it becomes unbearably painful.

I picked them up yesterday and was impressed to see they are still in one piece, no cracks or pieces dangling awkwardly. The cord is a bit frayed though I'm positive that simply from the onslaught of abuse they've endured.

Good, attentive customer support team effort.. Original Review:. Using this for PS4 so it's hooked up to my wireless controller during use.. I really wanted to like these headphones but I can't ever hear ANYTHING. there is so much static and audio cut out for me to enjoy a simple game. I don't know if this is a common issue for PS4 headsets or what but it is really annoying.. I gave this headset 2 stars because I like the design and it is comfortable but I really hate how I can't use them for their intended purpose.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.01718749999999998,0.6191964285714286
6,1.0,"I have never hated a headset more than I hate this one. It echos whenever you're in a voice chat, so people you're talking to hear themselves echo through your mic, EVEN IF YOU'RE MUTED. It constantly stopped transmitting sound when plugged in, causing me to have to unplug it and plug it back in many, many times before it decided to transmit sound again. Worst of all? Apparently, I'm not even allowed to return it, just ""talk to an expert"" to ""ask how-to questions"" as if I'm incompetent. I can't rate this lower than I have, but it's a 0/5 for me.

7,3.0,"*edit 4/9/2021*. The seller reached out to me to fix my issues with the headset. They offered to send me a new one, apparently they have a newer model that is better, so I don't know if they are still selling the model that I had issues with. I told them I had already gotten a replacement set and they were kind enough to offer me a refund for the product. I do appreciate how good their customer service is at reaching out to people who have had bad experience with their products.. *OG Review*. Bought this for work. I went to record a voiceover for a reading program I was doing (i'm a librarian) and the sound quality was HORRIBLE. I listened to the audio both with different headphones and over my computer speaker and the audio from the mic was so scratchy it was ridiculous. I had to completely scrap the audio recording, wait until everyone went to bed, and record it all again with my phone earbuds so I would have complete silence and at least passible sound quality. I wanted to return these but I unfortunately missed my window. Would NOT reccomend.","BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",0.009564393939393928,0.5982007575757576
8,4.0,"I am a 39 year old woman with a small head. I have a hard time even finding retail hats that fit me. So I have a horrible time finding any kind of headphones that fit and/or are not painful. I only just got these, and on the smallest setting they mostly fit. I could honestly have them just a little smaller and be perfect but at least these are not squeezing my head like a vice as so many do. The ear pieces go all the way around my ears so they are also not squeezing my ears which is painful. I think they will be ok for long periods of use because they do not hurt. The sound quality seems fine, I'm hearing surround sound in my game as I type this. My voice comes out clear as does those I am chatting with. It's easy to mute myself as well and change the volume right from the headset. Over all I think these are really good quality! And a great price!.

0,1.0,"At first when I got it, I assumed everything was fine, but i quickly noticed that there were a couple things off about the controller. It might have been my paranoia, but I dont think these controllers are authentic. My right analog stick has stopped working within 4 months of me buying the controller. I had my original controller for years before it stopped working, and this one didn't even last half a year. I don't understand how that is possible. I bought one from Best Buy on Black Friday and compared, and there are minute details that are off with the touch pad and the directional pad. Additionally, the serial number label on the back of the controller is different than the other controllers I have (two I bought from Best Buy a couple days ago).

They're lighter, the analog sticks are so loose, no stiffness at all, they just flop around, and they all die on me within a few months. There must be different manufacturers involved here.. EDIT; By die I mean they quit holding a charge for more than like 30 minutes.

2,1.0,Bought this as a backup for my original PS4 controller which is still working just fine. Used lightly for about 30 hours of game play and the problem started. The left thumb stick does not appear to any longer be returning to center/neutral making it impossible to correctly interact with games as you are unwillingly moved in different directions and are unable to stay still. Resetting the controller did not correct the issue. Realize that I am out of the return window so I just bit the bullet and bought another $42 replacement. I don't think that it is unrealistic to expect the controller to work longer than it did. Very disappointed.

3,1.0,"The left analog stick always wears out. You may not notice right away because it doesn't show in all games. In games where the left stick movement is very sensitive, certain directions will cause the character to shuffle their feet repeatedly because the controller's signal constantly shows a strong/weak press alternating. My first controller, this issue was when pressing around 1 o' clock on the analog, the second one is when I press straight to the left..

4,2.0,"I have gone through two Dualshock 4 new model controllers, one that came with my PS4 Pro and a second one I ordered a month later when the first one developed issues with the left analog stick. Now my second controller is showing the exact same issues.. The symptoms are that at some specific angle, in my case at the very least slightly to the left or right of straight forward, the stick will not respond properly. This will result in the game character for instance suddenly slowing to a walk from a run and back again, resulting in very stuttery movement. And over time the issue will get worse, with larger deadzones.. Sony will replace the controllers under warranty within one year, but the warranty process is inconvenient to say the least. You have to mail the controller to them, and you might not get it back for two or three weeks. Without a controller, the Playstation system is unuseable. There are several guides out there that detail how to replace the sticks yourself, but they require cracking the controller open and desoldering the stick to solder a new one in its place.. When the stick is behaving normally the controller is great, but with two in a row going bad like this I will be looking into a third party controller for sure.",DualShock 4 Wireless Controller for PlayStation 4 - Jet Black,0.0015689361143906675,0.33092002273820453

However, it has been a little over 1 month and the controller is starting to act faulty. With a full time job and college courses, I havent had much time to play, so it's not abuse on my part. The controller keeps shifting to the left even when my hands are off the controller. This happens during gameplay and during the initial playstation screen menu. I've turned the controller off and on, restarted the playstation, connected the USB cable to see if there is a difference and no matter what it seems to shift to the left.

9,1.0,I bought a Playstation in February and by April I had to buy this controller because the one that came with the bundle stopped working and its irreparable. Now this controller has been faulty from the get go. Both joysticks are not 100% responsive and the left joystick click works 1/3 times you click it. When I try to aim there is almost always a default left rotation that I have to struggle with in game. This also interferes with the sensitivity of the rotation to the right because I have to be fighting that left pull (so my left rotation can be super quick and then my right rotation can be slow; notice I say 'can' because this happens 50% of the time so it is random).. This has been happening since the 1st month of using the controller. It stopped for a while but the came back and it still there. I tried just getting used to it but it has affected my gameplay too much. Yesterday I used a friend's controller and I immediately felt the difference and did not feel restrained.,DualShock 4 Wireless Controller for PlayStation 4 - Jet Black,0.018315018315018305,0.2875457875457875
0,5.0,"I have definitely seen multiple improvements with these new PS4 controllers over the older ones. The battery lasts a lot longer, the thumbsticks are more rugged and have a better grip on them, L2 and R2 buttons are more springy (a good thing), and the thumbsticks also feel way smoother when moving them around. Other things I have noticed is that the buttons are now grey like the throwback controller and there is now a light on the touchpad. Although the last gen controllers are still pretty good, I would definitely recommend the new gen controllers for only $10 more.. Update: 12/4/17 This controller still functions as if it were new, even with heavy use which includes me dropping it on multiple occasions. It has outlasted three gen 1 controllers.. Bravo Sony!.

The easy of the control of things is exceptionally well designed and I don't have to put batteries in constantly as I did on the Steam controller.

So how does it look? Fairly cool. It's not as bright as the blue camo one but it's also not so dark that it looks like a solid color from a few feet away. The colors on the controller jump out at you and when the kids friends are over they quickly notice it. The reactions range from what's that to this thing is (insert word the kids are using for cool these days).. If your only debating purchasing this controller based on the color, I would suggest you go for it. It's an official Sony product so you don't have to worry about it not working or getting a cheapo knock off and it does really look cool.

Just follow what they say in their posts for how to determine if they are real or not. The biggest indicator being the middle touch pad. When you push in, it should not have a really loud clicking noise. It does have some noise, but not a super noticeable one. Other than that, the controller connects well, stays connected, has no lag, and the light bar works appropriately. I had no issues with it, and have been happy with the purchase.. Usually I list out pros and cons in my reviews, but I dont see a need. All pros for this as I mentioned above. It works like you would expect it to and was a fair price during playstation days of play. I would recommend that you NEVER buy a controller at full price of $59.99 plus. There are deals all the time like prime day and black friday where you get them for $40 or lower. Just keep that in mind as you shop for these if saving a few dollars matters to you (which it should).

The triggers, analog sticks, D-pad, and buttons are grey. While the touchpad looks to be black. The touchpad has the light shining through so at least it is the second model. There is audible sound of clicking when pressing the analog sticks and buttons which I compared to my MK1 controllers and they are not quite the same, I don‚Äôt know if because its new compared to my two others. The sticker info on the black has more info than the MK1. Where the two shells of the controller meet are rough difference there. The new one looks just a bit bigger grip wise to my other two..

8,1.0,"Right out of the box, it‚Äôs much lighter. This should maybe have been a red flag. Notice the only difference I can see other than that is the model number (CUH-ZCT2U) now has a ‚ÄúG1‚Äù next to it.. Buttons on the new controller feel clicker, but also mushier and everything has a more plastic feel to it. Definitely the cheaped out version.. Connected to my PS4 Pro, fired up a couple games (Apex, Fortnite) and noticed the controller performs terribly. Acting like there‚Äôs major input lag occurring. Switch back to my original CUH-ZCT2U and performance is normal. No issues. Feels good.. Been playing games on my laptop recent with my DS4 controller (Devil May Cry 5, Sekiro, Monster Hunter World). For anything in Steam (since they added support for DS4 controllers) everything works great with no addition programs or drivers using my original controller. Connecting the new controller to my laptop produced rapid phantom inputs as if arrow keys and other buttons were just being rapidly mashed. This would interrupt any attempts to open the start menu and notification bar, forcing me to put the laptop into airplane to disconnect the controller.

0,1.0,I thought this would be a great addition to the controllers I already have but sadly this was not the case. I opened up the packaging and went about syncing it like normal. The first thing I noticed was that the analog sticks were very tight and hard to move. Then came the issue with syncing. The controller will flash white nonstop and then eventually just turn off. I've done all the necessary steps to resync it including powering off the PS4 and still nothing. It appears to have issues with Bluetooth linking because it will blink constantly and then just power off. I tried to turn on the console and it wont turn on with this controller.

3,1.0,"I bought this controller to replace my original controllers that I have had for years. The original controller never had a problem until recently when the battery is unable to hold a charge for more than 30 minutes. A typical result of long-term battery use. With this new one purchased on Amazon, a few problems started right after the 30-day warranty ended.. 1. The right analog stick drifts to the point it‚Äôs unusable. I tried to fix it but nothing worked.. 2. The analog sticks feel cheaper than the original controller. In fact, all the buttons feel loose and clicky compared to the original controllers. The back triggers feel cheap too.. 3. I don‚Äôt know if this is a real sony controller or a knock-off. It looks the same, but overall felt cheaper.. 4. The battery was the only thing that lasted, if I wanted to play with analog drift issues that is.... 5. I paid top $$$ for this controller, and it‚Äôs a piece of junk. There is no other way to say this. It‚Äôs crap.. Again, I don‚Äôt know if Sony has tried to save money by making cheaper controllers or this is a knock-off. Either way, I threw it out.

EDIT: after reading other people‚Äôs reviews and going to a Best Buy to purchase another one - I have come to realize these controllers sold on Amazon are 100% fake, made to look as though they are branded by Sony.

5,1.0,"Purchased this as an upgrade to my 4 year old DS3 controller which I use with my Windows 10 gaming rig and SteamLink. I wanted the DS4 as the touchpad can operate as a mouse if needed. Unfortunately this DS4 exhibited drift on the left stick right out of the box. I've tried resetting it via the reset button, recalibrating it via the Windows game controller control panel, increasing the dead zone, recalibrating the controller via the hold the PS button for 30 seconds, rotate each stick 5 times clockwise and counter and hold the OS button for 30 seconds again, but none of that fixed the stick drift. This stick drift makes my game character move on it's own and look around on it's own. Obviously this makes this controller unusable. I am 99% sure this is actually a genuine controller as opposed to most of the poor people here getting counterfeit ones.

Definitely a bit bigger than the original (as I obviously have slightly bigger hands than I did when I was 18, and the DS4 feels girthier than I remember the DS being). But it's still comfortable to hold and has good weight distribution. I bought it to use when playing old games on my computer with emulators, and while it takes a little tinkering in Windows to get it to work, it does so great. The only issue I've had is keeping it paired in Bluetooth, but I think that might be an issue with my dongle and not with the controller (as the dongle is several years old). So I've mostly stuck to using it plugged directly into a USB port.. Actually, one small thing to note is that when I go into Discord, it thinks the mic on the remote is my headset mic, even though I have the controller disabled in sound settings.

9,4.0,"This is a pretty good digital code card for the price. The cardboard itself is sturdy, but not so rigid that it can't be folded for easy storage. The corners are pleasingly rounded, so it feels quite ergonomic, and fits snugly in the hand, with no pointed edges.. As a bonus, the card features a full color portrait of Shigeru Miyamoto's famous plumber Luigi Mario on the front. While the more expensive $20 card (which retails for around $20) features the more celebrated Mario Mario, if you're on a tight budget this is a reasonable alternative.. The back is rather plain, more function over fashion, and is largely monochrome. The one exception is a nice silver strip, which can be peeled away to reveal a code. The code can actually be typed into Nintendo's eShop, and will credit you're account with $10 in virtual currency. This effectively makes the card itself 'free'. It literally pays for itself.. All in all, I found this to be a decent mid-range eShop card. While it's not as impressive as more expensive models (the Mario Card, the $50 Bowser edition) it's twice as useful as the cheaper Toad version, and it's well worth shelling out (no pun intended) the extra cost.

3,1.0,"Fraudulent purchases going on. Reviews over the last two weeks show a lot of fraudulent purchases going on with these. It happened to me today:. Someone used my trade in account to trade in 4 games to which amazon gave my account an instant amount of money in gift cards (assuming I would send the games in the next 30 days).. These gift cards were then immediately used to purchase these eShop gift cards.. Oddly enough they don‚Äôt not show up under my digital orders and I get an error from the website when I click on the link to show the order details.. The more concerning thing is it appears they have access to email also. I was looking at my gmail account at the time it happened and saw the purchases in an email come in and the emails were immediately deleted permanently. It should be noted I have OTP enabled on my amazon account and didn‚Äôt get any requests and my passwords between amazon and gmail are different.. I immediately contacted amazon and they submitted a fraud report. They would not immediately refund the money pending an ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù. I do believe they ultimately will refund.. Also concerning is it seems to have been going on for several weeks now and the security breach still seems to be happening. I can‚Äôt be the first to point this out to amazon.. Follow up 5/3/2020. I talked to Amazon customer service multiple times. Each time was the same run around. They told me they would open a fraud report and someone would respond within 48 hours. No one ever responded. I could get back in contact with them and they would say the same thing. I did this 3 times. I finally got an email from someone at Amazon that said there is no security issue on my account.

5,1.0,"Obtaining an eShop card through Amazon should be very fast and convenient, but I had a nightmare experience with ordering this through this service.. I purchased a $70 gift card and went to check out, where I was prompted to verify my payment card. As if to say ""Why yes, I am me and have this card in my possession"" I re-entered my payment information and submitted the order.. After a few minutes, I checked to see if the code was available in my digital library, and it was listed as a pending purchase. After a few more minutes, it was still listed as pending. Then I checked a third time, and found that I was locked out of my account.. Upon investigating why my account was frozen, I found out that my legitimate purchase was labelled fraudulent by Amazon somehow and called customer service. The first time I called customer support (foreshadowing alert), I was told by a representative to wait for 24 hours for the fraud department to investigate... my legitimate purchase that I was telling them about, and she refused to help any further.. About 5 hours later, I went back to my account to see if anything had changed, and the order for the $70 gift card had disappeared and I could find no reference to it anywhere. Placing even the slightest amount of faith in humanity, I allowed myself to believe the problem had been corrected and the order was simply cancelled, so I ordered a $70 Nintendo eShop card.. This order ended up in pending orders limbo, where I found my previous order was still sitting right where I had left it. I called customer support again to attempt to resolve this matter and was greeted by the representative with all the reasons this issue was my fault.. The first thing I had done wrong, according to the representative, was not calling/notifying Amazon that I was a person intending to purchase the eShop card before I submitted my order. It sounded almost like there was some secondary verification process that I had seen no reference to and had failed to perform. The second thing I had done wrong was not giving their fraud department enough time to investigate (once again) THE LEGITIMATE PURCHASE I HAD MADE AND WAS TALKING TO THEM ABOUT.. All of that seems reasonable enough, but I could just offer the alternate suggestion that you, I dunno, maybe just let me use the service the way it was intended to select the item I want to buy, input my financial information, and then receive the thing that I exchanged currency to obtain. You know, commerce or whatever.. I would have wasted less time just driving to the store and buying one of those physical eShop cards where you scrape the back like a scratch ticket.

On Aug. 2, 2020, my 14-year old son bought a Nintendo eShop Gift Cards, expecting immediate (or very soon) download. In order for him to place the order, I had to give parental approval. After 4 hours, we called Amazon, only to find out his purchase was put on hold due to it being his first order - despite the fact it was approved by a parent. So I bought this $70 gift card so he could get the game he wanted. After several hours, and being put on hold by Amazon for a very long time (over half an hour!!!), I found out MY order was put on temporary hold, and would not be cleared until 3 or 4 in the morning. So I went to another online retailer, ordered the very same $70 Nintendo gift card, and voila, I had it in a matter of minutes (less than 5 minutes). I did get the email with download code the next day (Aug. 3) from Amazon for my $70 card.. Now the story turns worse. I saved the $70 gift card to give to my son for Christmas. My son attempts to use the download code and Nintendo says it's already been used. So now I go back to the other online retailer, buy another $70 card, and voila, my email with download code comes in less than 4 minutes from time of purchase, and it works okay..

0,5.0,"While it may sound backhanded to say that this is the best Mario game since Galaxy, it's not intended as such. Odyssey is spectacular. I've been playing Mario games since the very beginning, so I like to think I know a thing or two about them. Super Mario Odyssey may well be the best 3D Mario game ever made, and it's in my personal top 3 Mario games of all time.. As you might've seen advertised, the big new feature is Mario's sentient hat companion Cappy, who lets him possess many of the denizens of the various kingdoms you visit in this adventure. While the highlight of many Super Mario games throughout the years has always been the various suits and power-ups players can get their hands on, being able to outright become many of the creatures you come across is a twist on that formula that lets players do all kinds of new and sometimes unexpected things.. While the game is - as expected - family friendly, it provides layers of challenges for players of all ages. Some of the (optional) tasks in the game are outright hair-tearing, for only the most skilled players, but that's part of what achievement is all about! However, while the game is designed to appeal to everyone, Nintendo took the time to add some extra nods to long-time fans, not only in the worlds and the critters/characters you happen across, but through setpieces and a spectacular mid-game musical number that old-timers like me have to appreciate.. If you have a Switch, get this game. If you don't have a Switch, get one, and then get this game.

1,5.0,"This is our first Switch game - my little sister and I have squeezed many hours of co-op as both Mario and Cappy, with many more to go. Such a creative game with such accessible puzzles for all ages, even adults. The music is so wonderful and the environments are spectacular. The controls couldn't be simpler and you know, playing with another person gives you more moves to do with Mario and Cappy. I cannot remember the last time I played a game where playing co-op gave you an advantage other than replacing a buggy AI with a human player. It makes so much sense! There's a true motivation to play with someone else - and not ONLINE.. I must say the graphics in Odyssey are gorgeous, far beyond anything out of PS4 or Xbox One. Seriously. It's colorful, vibrant, and deep. Rich hues supplant dullness, even when in areas portrayed to be mysterious or cold. It's just short of inducing synesthesia.. I'm so glad Nintendo is finally back! This is the way gaming is supposed to be - light, endlessly fun and inspiring! Too many games on the ""Big Bad Consoles"" are so dark or filled with such negativity - it brings you down without realizing it. Even the ""fun"" titles are just uninspired - they just lack character & development. This Odyssey is such a breath of fresh air - it makes me want to just JUMP UP and go get Breath of the Wild next. Actually, it makes me and my sister just excited about everything, even when we aren't playing the game. We're happier individuals for playing Odyssey, no joke.. Nintendo, you've nailed it with the Switch and brought back the joys of gaming to a faithful 90's kid while giving the up and coming younger generation the discovery of something that has been missing from gaming for over 20 years - true, genuine inspiration.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.13270202020202018,0.4925252525252525

My son can sit and watch this as if it is a cartoon and remains entertained the entire time. Sometimes he will say ""make Mario do this"" and is excited when it happens on screen.

4,5.0,"Honestly this is my favorite console title to date. Very few games make me want to sit and play for hours on end. Even with Breath of the Wild, I haven't beaten it and can't get myself to play for extended periods of time.. But this game is glorious.. I'll leave this review spoiler free for the sake of those looking into purchasing this awesome title.. It took me about 4 days to beat the main story. This included getting 8 hours of sleep and a work/school schedule. But that was using all of my free time playing this fantastic game. And even after that, there is still a LOT to do after the main story, so I've been playing it still.. This is a console quality mario game. In my opinion it's the best 3d open-world mario title to date. Mario 64 will always have that nostaliga spot for me, but this is the new winner in my eyes. Not only because of the gameplay, but with the nature of the switch it's also a portable title. I played this while waiting at campus for a class to start. Almost was late to class because I lost track of time.. And the mechanics are great. Even after beating the main story, I find myself learning new advanced moves that make previously tall walls easy to get over.. The music is also good. Not all of it is super memorable, but there are several songs in there that I would pay to have downloaded on my phone.. I highly recommend anyone who is even remotely considering this game to pick it up. I wasn't even super excited to get it, but decided to give it a go and now it's my new gaming addiction.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.20961891643709826,0.562635445362718
5,5.0,"Mario Odyssey is pretty fantastic; it's easily the best Mario game that has come out since the Mario Galaxy series. But it's a little more than that.. The gimmick in this one is that you can throw a mind-control hat that allows you to forcefully rule the bodies of other people and creatures; this is probably why Nintendo released the game so close to Halloween in 2017. Mario invades the host like a pathogen and directly controls their motor skills. It's kind of like those parasitic worms that force ants to drown themselves; except you are the worm.. Goombas can scream only internally as you force them to smash their heads against blocks for your profit. After your hapless victim is no longer needed, they can be discarded by commanding them to walk off a cliff, right as you return Mario to the physical plane.. There's also minigames; such as racing a toy car. But you don't simply throw your hat onto the RC car; oh no. You throw your hat onto a FULLY-GROWN MAN, control his mind, and force his fingers to work the controller in his shaking hands.. While mechanically pleasing, I fear that the power given to Mario in this game is too great; and that his character may be crumbl- WAHOO! WAHOO!

6,5.0,"What can I say, I grew up playing Mario games & to this day no series of games gets me more excited than the Super Mario series. Super Mario Odyssey was the first true 3D Mario game we received since 2010 when Super Mario Galaxy 2 released. 3D Land & 3D World were both fun, but they didn't capture the feeling of a true 3D Mario game. In 2017 though we received Super Mario Odyssey!. Even though the Switch had been out for less than a year, here we had a game that was hyped up great, but could it live up to the hype? For me that answer is a mega YES! Super Mario Odyssey had everything that I had hoped for.. Quick Review:. -Amazing, creative, & ultra fun gameplay. -Power Moons are everywhere making it feel like the action never stops in Odyssey. -The different Kingdoms are almost all a blast to explore. -Epic soundtrack. -All of the different outfits Mario can wear in the game. -The final boss battle (the final boss battle, & ending had me so happy as a Mario fan that I had some water in my eyes). Cons:. -Beach volleyball (if you played this game you will understand). All in all this has become my all time favorite video game. Just the whole game made me happy (wife & kids enjoyed it a lot also), but for me it was just pure joy to play this game. Truly a magical game for me, I can't say enough good things about it. The Mario series has been a big part of my life, & has helped me through some rough times in my life, so just seeing how far Mario has come over the years with a game like this just makes me feel like a kid again.

7,3.0,"This edition of Super Mario combines some old and new elements, but takes a big part of it's inspiration from Super Mario 64's star collection and combines it with Korok seed hunting from Breath Of The Wild, giving you over 800 ""Power Moons"" to collect. The story portion is fairly short, and you will practically trip over a power moon every 10 feet to progress to the next kingdom. The game goes on after the theatrics of the story, and it's real content and hours of gameplay depend on if your willing to hunt down the remaining power moons in each kingdom, and thankfully only requires about 600 to unlock the last major challenge and a unique item for beating it.. Collecting every last moon however will often force you to complete some incredibly frustrating challenges that had me questioning that this was actually a game and not some attempt to put me in the hospital with a rage induced aneurysm. In particular, the jump rope challenge in New Donk city. Some challenges will require research into advanced jumping maneuvers the game doesn't explain. I wound up refusing to bother with the end-game moon collection until I had the hardest challenges out of the way, since I reasoned it would be wasting time on the rest for game if I knew I'd forever be two moons short of total completion.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.01992611298166855,0.4480733258511037

He absolutely loves it. Its challenging for him, but not impossible. I can hear him getting mad at something, working out how to beat it, and being so proud/happy/excited when he does. What makes it better is that he does it on his own. He doesnt feel so overwhelmed that he has to ask for help.. I cant tell you from a personal standpoint what the game is like, or even about.

Instead of jumping into paintings you use your Moon powered spaceship to fly to different worlds. And while it all feels similar there is so much that makes this game addicting and new. Every world you explore is rich in detail, with so many things to do that you are going to have a hard time completing everything! Any enemy without a hat on can now be controlled. Each enemy that you control has its own abilities and really helps create a dynamic world that allows you to explore, and accomplish the same goal multiple different ways..

0,5.0,"I finished this game a few weeks ago, and I've been pondering what I should write in review. When I say I ""finished"" it, I mean I FINISHED it. Made it past every single one of the ""endings,"" somehow. At some points, I wanted to rip my hair out in frustration. At others, I really just enjoyed climbing buildings and exploring what the Mario world has to offer (I'll tell you right now that it's a lot. There's a lot). This game occupied me for several weeks, yet somehow I never got bored. I debated even buying this game at first because some people (obviously more experienced gamers than I am) thought it was much too simple. However, i never got over the joy and utter satisfaction of getting a moon that I thought I would never see. Of course, if you just play through the main storyline, you'll be done in a few days. That's to be expected. But Nintendo has put several endings in the game, each significantly more difficult to achieve than the last. I finally finished the entire game weeks after I bought it and let me tell you, I have never felt such satisfaction. I thought I would genuinely have a heart attack trying to get some of those moons. Moral of the story, it's great for all ages and skill levels. A 7-year old could finish the main storyline and never touch it again and probably be content. But *anyone* has the option to keep playing for muuuuuch longer past that. Not the best for multiplayer, but it's still a fun time if someone wants to half-heartedly be a companion to player one. If you're debating getting this game, I say just get it.

1,5.0,"Nintendo has gone back to what made Super Mario 64 a great game and then took it to the next level. Forgotten are the sub-par Mario games in between.. I have spent only a few hours with the game, but I already have a feel for this one. First off, it is pretty easy. You lose coins when you 'die', and coins are literally everywhere. Seriously, the ground must be made of coins, they're that easy to find. But the puzzles are luckily pretty interesting. Many result in discovery of a moon piece. Others result in; you guessed it; coins. The maps are larger and you can warp to certain saved locations.. The one drawback is that Nintendo insists on making use of the joycons. I really hate them. Especially since I play with them attached to the unit while my wife plays PS4. But I have advanced quite a bit in the game even without using the extra motion control features. I think they make a few things easier, but I haven't felt like I couldn't accomplish something because I wasn't using them.. One nice feature is that the collecting of a moon doesn't take you out of the map (like collecting a star in Mario 64). So you can collect several each time through and not interrupt the action. You also then don't have partially completed puzzles reset (like finding and planting seeds in the Desert town).. Bottom line is that Nintendo has given us 3 great First-Party games on the Switch (Zelda, Mario Kart, Mario Odyssey). So it's been a good year for Nintendo fans that were fortunate enough to get a Switch (which I hear is easier now - I got mine on release day). That being said, I think Zelda is the better game by far, but that doesn't diminish the quality of this game - it's comparing apples to an entire apple orchard. Zelda is still the Switch game that is a MUST own. Mario Odyssey is a great game that is superbly polished - but it's still not what action adventure Mario games could be, but it's nearly there.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.1251322751322751,0.5373280423280421
2,5.0,"I normally wait for games to go on sale before buying them, but the trailer for Mario Odyssey was too awesome to pass up. As someone who's played a ton of Mario games on a bunch of consoles, I'm confident in saying that this is the most complete, best all-around game in the franchise. The innovation of the cap-throwing mechanism is an exciting new layer to the classic Mario formula, and opens up a lot of new ways to solve puzzles and other challenges. If you like using Joy-Cons for their motion controls, you can experience the game in a whole new way. The graphics are great, the story is fun, the worlds are unique and well-designed, and there are hidden levels you can unlock if you get to a certain point. You can easily spend over 100 hours on this game if you're trying to find all the moons.

3,3.0,"For a platformer, Odyssey is terribly executed. Nintendo forced motion controls in, which are expectedly unreliable and make combat unfair when Mario doesn't react to you movements they way you intend him to because the Joy-Cons don't capture movements correctly. The mandatory motion controls also means that if you want to play Odyssey on the go, you have to play with the Joy-Cons detached and the screen propped up; you can't play the Switch like the WiiU as if it's a giant GBA which is pretty stupid for a console that's entire selling point was its handheld abilities. If we put all that aside, the story is good for a Mario game and the visuals are better than previous Mario games, but that bar was never set very high. Since Mario games have to have a gimmick now, Odysseys is that Mario's hat was destroyed and now he wears a ghost on his head that shapes itself as a hat which Mario an throw at enemies to take control of them. It's an interesting idea and it was fun to play as a Goomba or a T-Rex, but the issue come with combat. Aside from the ground pound, all of Mario's attacks are ""hat"" based; you essentially throw your hat at enemies, which is fine, but when I throw the ""hat"" at a Goomba trying to attack it, the ""hat"" instead goes on the Goomba's head and now I'm controlling the Goomba. The other frustrating things are the unresponsive camera and just plain bad platforming, with Mario not responding to commands (not just motion controls) and seemingly jumping in roughly calibrated directions. I understand that Nintendo games have nuzzled comfortably into a ""Family Games"" category and maybe I'm coming at Odyssey too much as a gamer an not in the Nintendo Fan mindset, but Odyssey is a good Mario game, but really only okay as a game in general. I have some nitpicks about why do you have to buy new hats for Mario, if the ghost(?) is always your hat and can shift into any form it wants, and other minor things. Super Mario Odyssey is a platforming game with bad platforming mechanics on a system that's entire selling point was the ability to play it on the go, that kills that ability to shove in awful motion controls. If I look at Odyssey as a Mario game, it's an acceptable entry, but as a video game (specifically as a platformer) Odyssey doesn't really hit the mark.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,-0.07349020820449391,0.5400084518655947

Not so much. Sure there is some action, but most of it is puzzle solving, and childish interactions with hat people. Yes, hat people. You're saving a world populated by hats with eyes. I got as far as Sombrero world and went back to playing Animal Crossing. There's only so much time you can spend talking to hats until you begin to evaluate your life and your own mortality. Do you really want to be on your death bead and think ""I spent 72 hours of my life talking to computer generated hats"".. I may give it another try before I get rid of it, but honestly, this game seems geared to young children. Your 8 year old will probably love this game.

5,5.0,"Mario Odessey is easily the most hyped Mario since Mario 64. Unlike some, I refected on my opinion and changed with time. Now I've beaten every major Mario release excluding the Galaxy games. My first introduction to Mario is my earliest memory. Xmas 85 my step grandfather won a NES at a party a couple days before that they got from the original Nintendo test launch. Every adult was jumping while distracted by a scrolling thing. It was so odd how excited they were. Mario World brought graphics and multiple buttons for the best controls at the time. Mario 64 rewrote 3d gaming, acing 3d platforming on its first go and changing how we looked at 3d games. For Odessey I ignored all gameplay and trailers after the E3 presentation as to go in fresh. I judge this as a Mario game so I'm extra critical. So does it live up to the hype?. Almost... Gameplay first and it is snappy. The games features dynamic resolution to achieve 60 frames per second. In the PC community there is a saying,""Give me 60 or give me death."" It makes the game control easier, panning the camera and motion is smooth. This makes controlling Mario top notch. Never did I die and think it was the games fault. In fact the input timing at 60fps is so good, going to xenoblade 2 or BotW makes them feel delayed in comparison. The new hat mechanic is an interesting new twist, but at the cost of power ups. Which I did miss. It is fun controlling the enemies, and each have different capabilities to help progress and find moons. Eh the moons. The single laziest thing in the game. There are hundreds of them but you only need a fraction of that to beat the main game and you can buy moons. Yes you can buy moons if you can't get to 600+ on your own. So it's easy to get them and it turns into a collection thing. Collect golden coins, stage coins, moons to collect more stuff. Though I did enjoy getting many of the moons for their challenge they could be replaced with a lot of coins considering I can just buy them. The hat can also whip around using motion to beat lower enemies. It's all well polished, but the motion feels odd at best. The 2d parts are fun but very short. There were moments where I thought this was well thought out or this is really cool, but never did I say WOW! How did they do that?. For the game itself. There are coins that you can spend on a shop or death. There are stage coins that buy fitting stage outfits as well as decorations which are useless. Just more busy work. You are trying to save Peach again. Three hit bosses. Very typical. The stages are short. Like not any larger than some Mario 64 stages and there are not that many stages either. The t rex can only be used in a very limited section. This is the main problem of the whole game. Where the fun factor is high, it only lasts 15-20 hours max then you just get moments from then on. I beat the game in under 10hours, and I was exploring. Even the collecting busy work took me 30 hours to get enough to go to the real last stage. Botw lasted me 100 of hours of new exploration. This is padding pure and simple. Level design though small is well polished with a lot of secrets. The level design is the best of any platformers ever but it really really could have used a larger open area to each stage.. Graphics are just decent. Look a lot of compromises have been made to achieve 60fps. Mario and npcs look good, as well as locations, but textures and draw distances are poor. Pop in is really bad and the stages are smaller than you would think. Art style can only hide so much.. Sound is excellent. There is no voice acting, but the music and sound effects are stellar.. So is Odessey a good Mario game? Yes, however it feels very restrained and easy. That is until the real last stage where it gets very unforgiving to the point it doesn't fit with the rest of the game. In fact with that exception, I think this is accually the easiest Mario yet and gimicky. My kids will have no problem playing this, but even glossing over that. I can't let some nostalgia moments make me forget how short this is and small the ""worlds"" feel.. This is not the best game ever, not a chance, it's not even the best Mario it just tries to remind us of them. Mario3/World are probably the best givend their eras. But it's good. Really good. Like an instant classic and better than Sunshine or anyother modern Mario good. I liked using enemies powers, but it doesn't carry an entire game. It would have been great to get a flying power or jump on Yoshi. Costumes are a cute idea and thank the stars amiibo are not needed. After BotW this might be the second best game of the year. That said it's a fairly distant 2nd for me. But trounced Horizon or anything else. I can't see a bunch of adults excited to play this like the first game. Nor is it mind blowing like Mario 64. Its not revolutionary. Even Cappy kind of mimics Kirby. It's an easy buy, replay value is good and its a perfect platformer. Simply the best 3d platformer.

6,5.0,"Quick review from a 35 year old that grew up with NES Mario. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching (and playing) the Super Mario franchise for just about 30 years as it evolved and innovated the platforming genre. Super Mario Odyssey is the next evolution of the series, and gamers of all ages owe it to themselves to play it! The game runs silky smooth, the visuals are crisp and beautiful, the soundtrack is pure Mario Bros. that captures wonderment and adventure, and the controls are polished, intuitive, and responsive to a T. I cannot praise the work Nintendo put into Super Mario Odyssey enough, I can only imagine the amount long hours and weekends they surely sacrificed to build this masterpiece, and for that I thank them from the bottom of my heart.. I'm through with gushing, time to play more Super Mario Odyssey! With Zelda Breath of the Wild , and Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo as back to perfect form, no denying it.

7,5.0,"While I've only had a Nintendo Switch for a few months, I've been putting off buying this game because Nintendo's first party games rarely drop in price, and seeing trailers for Odyssey I wasn't really sure it was going to be my thing, despite all the positive reviews. But I decided to take the plunge and I'm both glad and sad. Glad that I did it, and sad that I didn't do it before. This is one of the best Mario games in existence. I hesitate it to call it the best ever because being frank there are a couple of titles I haven't played, but I have played the majority, and this one is definitely top 2.. The main reason for this is that this game does something that tickles my fancy, which is rewarding exploration. There's a decidedly non-linear nature to the game and while you do have to do a few things before being able to progress, you can tackle most of the world at your leisure and however you feel like it. Sure, every time you reach a new world the game points you in one direction, but you can choose to completely ignore that and travel around each world at your own pace, doing quests, discovering secrets and play around with all your available abilities, which are vast.. This is, of course, because now Mario has taken a page from fellow Nintendo companion Kirby, and is able to absorb the abilities of enemies, giving him a wide array of tools to play with. Worlds are large and full of content, a lot of it hidden, which is where exploration comes in. This is far from a Ubisoft game. The world isn't large for the sake of being large. Every nook and cranny is brimming with possibilities, and it's easy to get yourself branching out in different paths and completely forgetting your original goal because you're always discovering something new and intriguing.. If I have to give a negative is that the story makes Mario look like an inneffective hero, who's constantly being one-upped by Bowser and only winning at the end because Bowser stopped moving. Granted, the story is usually just window dressing for Mario games (save for the RPG titles, of course), but still, every time the game wrestles control from you for a cutscene you get to see Mario getting his butt handed to him and it becomes a bit irritating. I suggest you just ignore the story and get on with the gameplay, which is absolutely fantastic and it's the only important part of these games anyway.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.1396451033243486,0.6044283808434748
8,5.0,"Okay. I bought this cause I really wanted a second game besides Zelda (which is the reason I bought the Switch) to have to play and ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù (see what I did there) between them. Well, that went all out the window once I started playing. First off I‚Äôm a gamer. I‚Äôve been gaming since the Atari 2600, yes I‚Äôm an old fart 48 yr old gamer but a gamer non the less. I‚Äôve always ‚Äúliked‚Äù Mario but I wasn‚Äôt obsessed with him or the franchise. This game, Odyssey, has become my obsession. I love it. The worlds are excellent, the graphics are insanely beautiful, and the controls are tighter and better then some of the most sophisticated shooters I‚Äôve played on any platform or PC....if you can faintly hear popping noises in the background it‚Äôs all the PC gamers heads exploding across the net as I typed that....well looks like a bunch of moms getting their basements back. Anyway back to the review. The game is deep and rich and each world is uniquely individual. The jump between open world platform to side scrolling 2D Classic platform as you enter walls to play these homage Super Mario levels are stunning and too much fun. It‚Äôs playable art at it‚Äôs finest. The difficulty isn‚Äôt super hard, but it‚Äôs challenging. This isn‚Äôt MegaMan...it also isn‚Äôt the Smurfs. A death in Game will only cost you 5 coins so it‚Äôs hardly a spanking when coins regenerate as you do, so if your so inclined you could actually make money off your own demise. With that said to get to 100% completion will not be easy. As much fun as I‚Äôve had on the first 4 worlds it‚Äôs been very rewarding and I‚Äôll still need to revisit these worlds to get everything I didn‚Äôt collect through my first pass. I‚Äôm only 4 worlds in and I can honestly say it‚Äôs my favorite game of the past 5 years. Easy hands down.....and as much as I love Zelda Breath or the Wild....Mario is ....well Mario is better..

In short, this is a spiritual sequel to Super Mario 64 but with better graphics, better gameplay, portability and levels completely different (for the most part) from anything Mario has ever gone through. Like Breath of the Wild, even after beating this game you can keep playing endlessly. Of course, I own my own copy, 80 hours in and only scratching the surface of what's offered here. There are.... hmm...about 10 billion moons for Mario to collect in this game? If you‚Äôre worried about the new hat mechanics, honestly, I‚Äôm surprised Nintendo didn‚Äôt allow Mario to platform on his hat decades ago. If you‚Äôre worried about motion controls, you can play this entire game without motion controls, but I consider myself relatively hardcore and prefer playing with motion controls. I also sense significant DLC content coming out for this but no guarantees - right now all we have are creepy Luigi hide-and-seek, balloon games (*sigh* Nintendo ALWAYS shafts Luigi). Buy it my friends, Nintendo is back.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.1167255259360522,0.5438121819700766
1,4.0,"I was kind of looking for a way to pass the time during COVID social distancing so I thought I might pick up a little gaming for the first time since I was a kid. Love the graphics and the childhood nostalgia this brings back as well as the new ‚Äúskills‚Äù Mario has in this one, and I also love the integration of the 2D old school-type challenges, but this game is overly gratuitous and just... easy. Mario 64 was the last game I really played faithfully (of course it‚Äôs been years) and it was at least a little challenging and you had to problem solve a little. Odyssey practically throws your goal (collecting ‚ÄúPower Moons‚Äù) in your face, sometimes within about 30 seconds of arriving in a new ‚Äúworld.‚Äù I miss the problem solving of the Mario 64 and Zelda: BOTW type games, and if you‚Äôre looking for a sandbox game with extensive area to roam, this is also not it.

2,5.0,I have been playing Mario since NES and this is one of my absolute favorites!!. Love the graphics in HD the beautiful design and gorgeous worlds and themes. Nothing bugs me more than when Nintendo just remasters existing games to sell to us the same thing over and over again same game different platform. I wait rather impatiently for them to come out with something new and amazing. But when they come out with something completely new and innovative it‚Äôs worth every penny and the experience is a delight. That is what SMO is. Countless hours of entertainment and Fung mini/side quest opportunities.. I love that the game just keeps going and going. There is the main story line but then hidden worlds and more work to be done even after the main storyline ends.. If I won the lottery I would spend countless hours on video games. Unfortunately I‚Äôm stuck to random winter weekend binges or vacation time deep dives. This was my most recent and it was long overdue and extremely worth it.

3,5.0,"What does a pandemic do to someone? Well, you steal your kid's Nintendo Switch and start playing old classic games available on Nintendo Online... Then they get Animal Crossing and it is hard to borrow. So my wife and kids got me a Switch for my birthday along with Zelda BOTW. I cannot allow myself to get immersed in that at the moment; I do have a job. So I picked up Odyssey. WOW! Well I got immersed. Fantastic game. I only allow myself about an hour or so a night and a little more on weekends. Probably the best 3D Mario game of all time (though Bowsers Fury is pretty fun too, just have not spent a lot of time with it).. I was a teen when the NES came out and, if I recall, included Super Mario Bros. We played that game all the time and it was a blast. This game has a 50+ year old man feeling like that teen again. My kids enjoy watching in amazement. So we picked up another copy of this game for each of them to explore on their own.

That being said, I tend to have pretty high expectations. This game is NOT a let down. I probably haven't even gotten to the best part of the game yet! The best part (by far) are all of Mario's quirks, expressions, and mannerisms. This is the most real he's ever felt. There's just so much to love, give it a try! P.S. another great part of the game is controlling Mario's wardrobe. See the attached picture! It couldn't get better than this.

5,5.0,"Nintendo was my 2nd favorite gaming console, Atari was my 1st. Amazing what changes of progress have been made thru-out the decades.. Prior to my latest purchase of a Switch Lite, last Nintendo system I had bought was the GameCube. Enjoy playing thru Resident Evil 4 til this day. Still have my Super, N64, & GBA(which I'm about to swap lcd screen). On the 64, never played Mario 64, thought it looked cool but was completely burned out of Mario for different reasons. Didn't play any Nintendo systems after GameCube. So decided to picked up Odyssey, WOW! Such a polished & enjoyable game. It blew my mind & had me putting in work. Think I'm over 800+ moons now. So, don't know if I would feel the same being so removed from Mario games for so long. Great accomplishment.

6,5.0,"I've been playing Mario games since the original was released 34 years ago. This is the best Mario game I have ever played. It is so astonishing, that is difficult to put into words. Although the Nintendo Switch is not as technically powerful as its competitors in Sony's PlayStation Pro and Xbox One's new iteration in X. The graphics are strikingly amazing, with colors so beautiful you just want to toggle the right analog stick to look around. The controls are perfectly intuitive and responsive. The sound is so engrossing, that it appreciably enhances the game This game just eviscerated any and all of the competition in the platforming market, and any other genre for that matter. There is a reason why this has an aggregate score of 97%. Even though it is relatively easy to ""beat"" the game, to complete it is another matter. I don't want to spoil anything, but the final encounter is a culmination of different gauntlets that will challenge even veteran game players.

The graphics are beautiful but the game is lacking the Mario feel : / i also didn't like that none of the original bosses were a boss they added in some newer characters that were just kind of random, I really wanted to love the game but I dont..it's cute and I'll always love Mario but this just wasn't that fun or challenging and was almost just really repetitive.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.15071839080459773,0.5932950191570882
8,5.0,"A quick PSA: The Switch is region-free, so you can safely play games from other regions without issues. Just make sure the game you buy supports your language!. Super Mario Odyssey is an excellent Switch game that is worthy of its series pedigree from start to finish. The varied Kingdoms/zones in the game are visually pleasant, full of colorful characters, and hide a myriad of secrets. Outside of boss fights and challenging platforming sections, which aren't common, the game is a relaxing experience that encourages the player to explore every corner in search of Power Moons (This game's version of stars/shines). Perhaps the most fun and interesting new mechanic is presented in the form of Cappy, Mario's talking hat replacement, who can possess most enemies and grant Mario new ways to traverse the world. Two players can play the game: One as Mario, the other as Cappy.. ...Seriously, why are you still reading reviews? This game has something for everyone!",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.1261503928170595,0.5252338196782642
9,5.0,"I absolutely adore this game. The gameplay mechanics draw from those of Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy. And the addition of Cappy, Mario's new hat and traveling buddy, adds so much to the classic Super Mario formula of defeating Bowser and saving the princess. With Cappy, lots of special attacks are possible, as well as the ability to ""capture"" and control certain characters and enemies.. There are lots of worlds to explore, and literally hundreds of Power Moons (the game's main collectible) to obtain. A multiplayer mode is available as well, where one player controls Mario and Player 2 controls Cappy. And after the last update, more outfits/costumes are available for Mario, as well as an online multiplayer game called Balloon World.. Super Mario Odyssey is a great place to start for those (if any?) who are new to the Super Mario series, but there's also a lot of fun and nostalgia for longtime vets of Mario games.

There is amiibo compatibility, but it‚Äôs so minimal that you needn‚Äôt worry about having any. There are three specific amiibo made for this game that give you costumes in advance, and more, but it‚Äôs really not worth mentioning it all. If you‚Äôre interested, look it up.. There is two-player for this. One person can be Mario while the other is Cappy. Cappy can be controlled in this mode. He can‚Äôt move too far away from Mario, but it‚Äôs a fun way to play with a friend, especially if they don‚Äôt know anything about the game..

1,5.0,"I guess I'm a bit late on this review -- and what is there to say at this point that hasn't already been said? Still, this game deserves the praise. It's one of the best I've ever experienced.. I played through this game with my kids, 5 and 11. All three of us were able to thoroughly enjoy playing through various parts, though some stages were initially difficult for my 5 year old. The game's Assist Mode is perfect for that kind of situation, and enabled all of us to play and enjoy at whatever challenge level was appropriate.. Game play is intuitive and the ""capture"" mechanism -- whereby you can play the game as a number of different creatures -- and wide variety of worlds keeps things interesting and engaging. We played the entire main story, then continued for quite a while, hitting most of the post-story goals. There is a tremendous amount to explore and do both before and after you beat the main goal of the game, making this title a great value in addition to simply a great game to play.. I would be remiss in my duties as a reviewer if I didn't mention one of my personal favorite aspects of this game, which is that it beautifully combines and melds elements of the old 2D Super Mario world with the current 3D state of the art. While my kids didn't really appreciate what they refer to as the ""old-fashioned video game"" sections, anyone who enjoyed the original NES Super Mario Bros titles will find that this game will not only give you something new, but will also bring back a lot of great memories.. Simply a fantastic game. Well worth the money and time investment.

2,5.0,"Pros:. - The movement and jumping mechanics feel amazingly fluid and responsive.. - This game opens up so much more possibilities for players who take the time to learn how to jump skillfully. I recommend that you do so, as it will add another layer of depth to the game.. - This game rewards players who explore and attempt to do what seems impossible.. - The ""transform"" mechanic is really fun and creative.. - Many callbacks to SM64 and other Mario games. This game provides plenty of fan service, especially towards the end.. - Grinding for coins does not feel like a chore and can be fun, especially if you have Nintendo Online (Luigi's balloon world anyone?). Cons:. - Some of the kingdoms felt rushed. You can tell that only a select few kingdoms received most of the love.. - There are way too many filler moons. Nintendo could have cut the moon count in half and there would still be too much filler. It does scratch that collector's itch, but truly challenging moons are very sparse in this game.. - The cutscenes when travelling from kingdom to kingdom can get a bit annoying. It does improve towards the end of the game, though.. All in all, this was a fantastic experience and I'm still not quite done with it yet. 5/5.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.02006172839506173,0.5348765432098767
3,5.0,"Love this game. I've been craving for a true 3d open world mario game since sunshine and it feels great to have that craving satisfied. It doesn't feel as platforming heavy as sunshine or 64 but more focused on simple exploration.Don't worry however, there are still plenty of platforming levels and a few that are particularly difficult. A kid could still beat this game easily by just picking up the easy moons instead of the harder ones so the difficulty really depends on how you play it. A speedrun community has already popped up and started challenges like the no jump challenge or plain difficult stunts to pull off in game. Overall it's not very difficult a game aside from a few frustrating levels or if you play in a way meant to challenge yourself,but it is loads of fun discovering the new world's and enemit's to capture.

4,3.0,"Lots of reviewers say this game is either perfect or revolutionary. I'm not a big gamer so can't really compare to other games. But it was just OK for me. Lots of stuff to do! Sometimes very cute, liked the costumes. Can really go back and play multiple times. However, I did find the gameplay to be repetitive and not as engaging as some online games. Also didn't like the frequent video sequences. It's family-friendly. I enjoyed it but it didn't take my breath away. The most fun part is probably the thrill of discovery and the cute outfits. Lots of innovative platforming, though the 2d sections were annoying. Chasing moons itself doesn't feel rewarding. Except, Cappy sits on Mario's head, so is he possessing Mario this whole time? and when Cappy is flung on another creature, why does Mario go with him? You see the game has some philosophical stuff to ponder, too. I got my copy on sale.

You define get your money's worth.. The only downside of this game, in my opinion, is that it's not a lot for in 2 player mode, but it's fun to switch off to collect moons (the main point of the game).

6,4.0,"I know the newer Mario games are aimed for younger audiences, so Nintendo is gonna obviously make it easier for the youngins, but as someone who's played Mario games since the NES days, I see myself blasting through this game like nothing (and yes I have it on the ""regular mode"" difficulty). No lives = real penalties for dying (You lose a measly 10 coins, which you can get back again in like 15 seconds), course challenges can be completed in 5-10 minutes, it's possible to get enough ""moons"" to progress to the next level in like 35 minutes - not only that but you can get enough moon pieces without completing the world's quest line, meaning you can ignore that world's problem & just continue the quest to save Peach, as extra moon pieces don't do anything at all.. Despite Odyssey's difficulty practically being Tee-ball, the worlds Mario explores are cool, the music is nice, the Cappy mechanic is interesting & fun to control different items, people & creatures, and the 2 Player mode is a nice addition..

0,5.0,"I have not had this much fun with a Mario game since Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64 system when it came out back in the days. Hands down the best, most true-to-character Mario game in recent history. This is the essence of what a platform game should be and Nintendo should be proud of themselves for taking their beloved franchise to new levels. Green Mushrooms for all!. Honestly, I grew up playing Nintendo. The NES started video gaming for me. And I owned every nintendo system outside of handhelds and the Wii U. However, during my late teens and early 20's, I shifted into playing more ""hardcore"" games on systems like PS2, PS3, PS4, etc.etc. Initially I owned a Wii, but hardly spent any time with it. Basically, I have been out of the Mario scene for some time. The Switch changed that for me.. Mario Odyssey rules. Here is the general gist of what this game is all about:. Bowser steals Peach (like always) and wants to force her to marry him (like always). Peach has a little animated princess crown companion that just happens to be the heartthrob of Mario's animated hat companion, Cappy. Of course, Mario gotta get his girl back and Cappy is more than happy to oblige helping Mario do this by way of providing Mario new skills. Motivated to help Mario acheive his goals, Cappy brings a new dimension of play in multiple ways.. Mario's mission is to travel between different themed worlds in his quest to chase down Bowser. Marios does this aboard a glorified hot air baloon that is powered by a resourced called Moons. Each world has a plethora of moons; some in plain view, some tied to ""quests"" and a WHOLE BUNCH that are hidden behind secret walls, portals, mini games, etc. Collect enough Moons on each world and it unlocks travel to the next world. So on and so forth till you catch up to Bowser.. Cappy brings a bunch of new mechanics to Odyssey beyond just being a nifty weapon to use against baddies. Cappy allows you to use elements in the environment to ""possess"" things that allow you to get around each unique world Mario visits. Sometimes you can possess switches that propel you along walls like a rubber band. Other times you can possess power lines and travel as a ball of lightning to different areas. And sometimes you can use Cappy to open doors into challenges that you have to complete hatless and without his help. These can be especially challenging and really give you an appreciation for what Cappy can do for you. The old addage ""you can never truly appreciate something until its gone"" really rings your bell during these challenges.. The idea of Cappy being this chameleon companion that can also possess certain types of enemies is pretty cool. I have always wondered what it would be like to be a dreaded goomba (many a killer of Mario) or a fireball-spitting venus fly trap. There is quite a feeling of gratitude when you can finally turn your enemy's weapons against them! For so long I HATED getting fireballed or eaten by those dang venus fly traps popping out of pipes!!!. There are also some new enemies for Mario to deal with, as well, and they play an important role in Mario's new adventure. The true GENIUS of this enemy-possessing ability is making it part of the puzzle. The enemies you possess become integral to unlocking secrets and progressing through each world. In fact, you cannot progress without this mechanic.. Whether its possessing fish in an underwater tunnel to keep Mario from drowning or using Cappy's Exorcist-style mind control on a frying pan flinging turtleshell so you can destroy giant blocks of cheese YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! The ridiculous level of fun never ends.. Outside of using Cappy for all the cool above-mentioned things, the platform experience is truly on point. This IS a Mario game, afterall. Nintendo has even managed to fit in a nice little throwback to the early Mario days via pipes spread out across the different worlds that teleport you to an old-school version of Mario in bit-style graphics armed with only your jump button. Truly retro. Oh, and to top it off, you transform into your 8-bit version WITH your current costume on.. Oh, did I forget costumes?? Yes indeed. You can change Mario's outfit to personalize his looks and to also unlock secret areas that require you to be dressed a certain way.. The only wish I have for this game is some of the worlds are rather short lived experiences and I wish there was more content. Also, you are forced to travel in a linear fashion from world-to-world even when the road ""forks"" and you are given a choice which one you want to visit first. Even though it would seem like there is a ""progression"" going on, each world is disjointed and theres no real overall ""theme"" to the game other than collecting Moons and chasing Bowser. I never felt like any one world was ""easier"" than the other; there are just different and surprising mechanics going on in each world. This makes each one feel really unique and whimsical, but doesnt lend itself to a cohesive story. The boss fights also become redundant and predictable after a while.. While there are a lot of extra Moons you can squeeze out of each world, and you are free to travel between already unlocked worlds, I dont see a lot of replayability in this game other than being a ""completionist"" and really digging to get every list completed. Dont let that detract you from playing, however. This game will constantly surprise you!. Hats off to Nintendo (yes I punned you there) for bringing me back to Mario land.

5,4.0,For me this game is about reliving the best video game of all time (Super Mario 64). While Odyssey isn't as good as the original by any means it is still a great game. It is disappointing compared to Breath of the Wild which is clearly leaps and bounds beyond the original Zelda game. If you don't get Breath of the Wild and you have a switch you are missing out on one of Nintendo's best achievements. So back to Odyssey. The game doesn't feel nearly as extensive as the original one. It is creative at times but borrows so many ideas from the original that it isn't nearly as impressive. The hat mechanic is great. The music is great. But yeah nothing is going to compare to the original soundtrack and creativity.,Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.2521604938271605,0.5419753086419754
6,5.0,"Can't say much other than it's seriously just one of the best games I've ever played. I have a high-end gaming pc, and a PS 4, and somehow, this game has won me over! Nintendo truly nailed it with the Switch and the new Mario & Zelda games that have come out so far. The game is not difficult, and even offers an Assist Mode that gives more health, no fall deaths and no health loss under water. I was playing 60% of the game in regular mode, but then was getting too annoyed with silly fall deaths. Switched over (no pun intended) to Assist Mode, and while I felt ashamed at first, I actually ended up enjoying the game far more! I was able to explore a lot more and experiment way more, thus, really getting a better feel for each environment. I also absolutely love how this game references just about all the big Mario games including Super Mario 64. Really, well done Nintendo!",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.11287878787878788,0.48243783993783984
7,5.0,"Now celebrating his 35th anniversary with the 3D All Stars Collection on Switch, Super Mario Odyssey became the perfect platform to push off the wonderful new hybrid handheld console. As far as 3D Mario games go I feel like they've mostly improved since their establishment on the N64, which makes Odyssey a crown jewel for a system that just continues to rack up fantastic first party titles.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.46496212121212116,0.7318181818181818
8,4.0,"I appreciate this game because I loved Super Mario on the Super Nintendo and also on the Nintendo 64. I was looking for something like that again. Hard to find, but this seems to do the job okay. I enjoy it, but also found it hard to stop comparing it all the time to the previous versions. Fun game to play if you are an adult and just want your kid to kind of be involved in the game, but also you have the control. The hat he wears gets played by the 2nd player. It gets launched around in a spinning motion, killing enemies for you, activating switches, and reaching coins you can reach. You get to buy other hats. And, this game is cute because you can play Mario in his undies. Made me laugh. You also get to change into other characters that the hat gets thrown on and Mario become the being that you throw it on. One time, you get to become a dinosaur. So, that's cool. I am pleased.",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.10530303030303029,0.49469696969696975
9,5.0,"I love this game! It is as challenging as you want it to be. The main story is not that difficult and takes only a few hours to complete, however, once you ""beat"" the game it transforms and opens up new places in the levels you've already visited!. As a child, you could play through the game and feel successful and enjoy your time, but as a more competitive adult, you can challenge yourself to collect all the ""power moons"" and unlock new games, outfits, and even new levels.. The storyline is very basic. There is not a whole lot of deep insight or meaningful morals, but with a few exceptions, Mario has always been about gameplay.. The controls are easy to learn, but again they are as challenging as you want them to be. You can beat the game with just a simple jump and hat throw, or you can learn flying leaps, spin attacks, and mid-air attacks.. If you really want to know more, I would look up Super Mario Odyssey on Youtube and watch game plays to get a good idea (I always recommend VideoGameDunkey. He gives very good reviews and analysis, but also he is just hilarious (there is some language))",Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch,0.14959136822773186,0.5317155319428047

1,5.0,"This is the definitive edition version of Mario Kart 8, and a must buy for those who never owned the Wii U version. For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version:. 1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original. 2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl). 3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item. 4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth. 5. ""Smart Steering"" A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active.. 6. ""Auto-accelerate"" for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral. 7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup. 8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against. 9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on. 10. Online Play.. -Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the ""Y"" button during the course selection screen of an online lobby.. - You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early. -When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match. - More icon packs for tournament mode. 11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen. 12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo. 13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game. 14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages. 15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc). 16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match. 17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types:. -Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points.. -Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell. -Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs. -Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out. -Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it. ==Additional notes:. - There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps. -There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players. -Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse. -No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down. -No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo. -Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced. -Other balance changes:. Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost.. Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on. If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked.. Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shell. Easier to break while drifting (advanced tactic). -Luigi still has his signature death stare. If there's anything I missed please put it in the comments.. Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.10276301679971404,0.4176995710711308

I haven't really played much video games since the N64 (skipped both the Wii and WiiU, so I kinda feel like an old man jumping back into the World of Nintendo). It's made me feel like a kid again, and with how much stress I've been under these last few years with my health... that's a pretty big deal to me. Thank you, Nintendo.

3,3.0,"The game is great with friends I love playing it with others right next to me. Other than that, I agree with some of the other reviews that this game could use some major improvements. They have relegated the extra power ups so that you only get them if you are in certain positions. So if you are in first you never get shells or invincibility stars or anything like that. So, holding onto the first position puts you at a disadvantage? I would think everyone behind you gunning for your spot was enough of a disadvantage. Really, this does not affect the person in front as much as much as you would expect though because those behind him are now in a firing range where everyone has weapons and are busy slowing each other down. So, if you manage to get out front with a bit of headway its usually pretty easy to win otherwise if your stuck with the masses it can get pretty difficult. I would prefer a fully random draw of power ups. For the more battle royal missions they have added cheap gimmick spots into the maps such as one where there is a ramp onto the walls that players can just stop on top of and take a rest and others cant acually reach those players without going out of their ways to aim just for them.",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.08953993055555555,0.5147197420634921
4,5.0,"Mario Kart 8 deluxe has the same racing courses as on the WiiU, but they made a few changes that greatly improved the game.. Battle. This was the biggest, best change they made. Instead of driving aimlessly through regular courses hoping you pass someone, they have created battle-specific courses, making battle more intense. There are 5 different modes in battle: balloon battle, coin runner, renegade roundup, ba-bomb blast, and shine thief. All are great. Our family favorite is Renegade Roundup.. Beginner mode. They have added two new features that make this game more bearable while playing with small children. You can turn on your rc (at least that's what we call it. It gives you an antenna that makes your kart look like an RC car). This will make it so you cannot fall off the track. If you have this on, the game doesn't allows you to take some of the secret shortcuts.. They also have an auto accelerator. This makes it so you do not have to push the gas the entire race.. We were hesitant to buy this because it's basically the same as the WiiU version, but their improvements made it worth the money.",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.13574380165289257,0.4821122059758423

6,4.0,"One of the main reasons I purchased a Nintendo Switch aside from it's hybrid functionality is it's ease of playing with others and enjoying a variety of game experiences. Mario Kart offers such awesome experience that it's perfect for a married couple. My wife and I constantly play together when we can and truly have fun! The game itself is very colorful and runs smoothly no matter how you decide to play. It's easy to pick-up and play for newcomers or people that are not into video games yet it also offers challenging modes for veterans of the series.. My only 2 gripes for the game itself is the character roster as well as unlockables or lack there of. The roster is comprised of some familiar faces but I wish there was more variety. It feels as if the koopa characters and other costume/baby variants of characters are fillers. It would have been nice to see characters from other franchises similar to super smash bros. That brings me into the second point which is the absence of unlockables. From the start all the characters and courses are available to you. The only items you are able to unlock are parts to customize your ride but I wish other forms of rewards were introduced such as more characters, courses, and an achievement list.. Despite the two drawbacks of the game this is the definitive edition and it does not take away from the overall experience of having a great time playing with other people. It is easily a must own game the defines what the Nintendo Switch is all about!",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.17610416666666664,0.5061249999999999
7,1.0,"This game is super disappointing compared to the gamecube version. The lack of user options and bad design makes it not worth buying. Examples include if you're ever in first or second place in a race, you'll never get any decent powerups. You'll generally be stuck with coins or bananas. You can't hit people to knock them off course and the jump feature is more like a miniature hop that doesn't matter at all. You can't selectwhich powerups are allowed in races or how many cpu ai's there are. This also goes for the battle mode. When playing balloons battle, you can't ram people to steal ballons. In fact, this game doesn't even have an in game settings page. This is a shameful production from Nintendo.",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,-0.06538461538461537,0.4487179487179488

I never unlocked much on the Wii U and didn't buy any DLC, and for various reasons, I didn't even enjoy playing MK8 on the Wii U. So even tho I purchased the same game twice, I have no regrets. I've only played single player mode, which is pretty boring (I always get 1st place). Online play is where it's at, even tho I am consistently in 12th place and losing points, it's still fun. I understand that Nintendo plans to make their online gaming a subscription based model before the end of 2017, so we'll see if I'm singing the same tune then.. Tried it with various controllers: a bare naked Joy-Con, a Joy-Con in one of those steering wheels, the Joy-Con comfort grip, and the Pro controller.

The courses are diverse and visually stunning, which make them fun the first few times you try them. But there is NO challenge whatsoever. There are four different rainbow roads and I couldn't fall off of them when I TRIED to. The camera and course automatically moves you around obstacles so you could probably just hold down the A button and you'd still beat half the NPCs.. On the other hand, if you want a game that your five year old and fifteen year old can play together, this is ideal. It levels the playing field across age ranges because you can't use strategy with your item throwing to screw over other players..

3,5.0,"I remember first playing Mario Kart back shortly after the launch of the Super Nintendo. I was hooked from day one. I'd rush home after school to play against my friends, my sibling, and even my parents. As time went on my friends and I got older and moved on to play late night 4 player battle modes on the N64. Even more time went on and all of a sudden we found ourselves too busy in adulthood to dork out like we did as kids.. Now in my early 30s, I knew I wanted a Switch from the moment it was announced. I knew, deep down, that it would deliver on the key franchises that I loved so much growing up.. I'm happy to report that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ABSOLUTELY delivers. From the gorgeous and smooth graphics to the wonky sound effects and quick styled gameplay - it's a TON of fun.

5,4.0,"Wii U owners might remember that the original Mario Kart 8 was released for that home console back in 2014. Three years later, and we now have Mario Kart Deluxe, a way for Nintendo to capitalize on their huge Mario Kart fan-base without dedicating too much time and money into producing the 9th iteration of the franchise this early into the Nintendo Switch's lifespan. For the most part, Deluxe is identical to the original MK8, with a couple new features included to give players a reason to pay full price again for what is essentially the same game. These include additional Battle Modes, some new tracks, characters and vehicles, all the DLC from the original Wii U version, and some refinements to online multiplayer (such as being able to change vehicles and characters without leaving the online multiplayer lobby). Of course, the main draw to getting Deluxe is being able to play Mario Kart 8 on a handheld device, which for all intents and purposes has now eliminated the reason for players to still be using Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS. However, the real question is if all these minor enhancements are enough to make MK8 players spend full price again on what is essentially the same game. The answer to that is two-fold. For people who still own a Wii U system and the original Mario Kart 8, I would not recommend getting Deluxe. However, if you're planning on selling your Wii U and upgrading to the Nintendo Switch, or you never bought a Wii U in the first place, then yes, I would recommend getting Deluxe, as it will probably be several more years before we see a true Mario Kart 9 sequel.",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.24025389025389024,0.5033988533988534

7,5.0,"Mario Kart is always a classic that I love. Fell in love with the original Wii version and this one is much better. Some of the maps you'll recognize but many have new twists and there are new maps to race. I love the battle games as well. (Balloon Battle is my personal favorite) Switching to two or more player mode is easy. (When you first try two player, for some reason the settings will be all turned on such as the safer driving mode, so drifts don't work as well, and the players kart will always be hitting the gas, and in battle mode that's not convenient so make sure you turn those settings off). And online playing is a welcome addition. You can choose between regional and world. There isn't a 'Grand Prix' in the online racing, just one race at a time. And playing Battle online, there's just one round at a time, no 4 rounds and then a winner is decided. Also there's no picking which battle game you want to play, it just cycles through the five. At first I didn't like it but it forced me to get better at games I didn't really play often. In the online playing there is a personal point system. You start out with 1,000 points and depending how you rank each round, you can either earn or lose points. (Got down to 988 and back up to 1250). While the console comes with two controllers, I find myself considering buying another set because I don't like the feel of playing with one controller, as it's so small.

You can either use the joystick on the controller to steer the kart or use the controller like a steering wheel. And the third is an acceleration assistance.

This is my favorite switch game so far. There‚Äôs a lot of race courses and the game is deep enough to entertain you for a while.. I highly recommend getting the online Nintendo subscription($20/year) to play against people from all around the world. It makes the game even more fun to play since there‚Äôs people out there with all sorts of driving skill levels and you never know just how a race will turn out..

4,5.0,"All Mario Kart games have always been a great game for friends and family of all ages. I had the Wii U version and already knew this is an amazing game. The fact that it has all the DLC included makes it an incredible deal. So many courses and if Nintendo made more DLC courses available for purchase I would buy them all in a heartbeat.. The added steering assist option is great for kids and non-serious gamers. It helps them stay in the race and keeps then from feeling bad about their performance. Don't worry if you are a serious Mario Kart racer rest assure that the steering assist disable the purple drift boost and forces the kart to stay on the main path, which makes it hard to take advantage of shortcuts.. My only very minor complaint is you cannot choose the battle mode to play; they cycle through the battle modes. Probably cause everyone only only play the balloon battle mode. My girlfriend and I only play the course races online now and that is more than enough fun..

7,4.0,"Very fun classic mario kart.. But.. It's too much of a giver!. I didn't really feel like I had any progression in the game!. When you get the game all the levels, stages, and characters are unlocked already (save for the amiibo dlc). The only thing you can really unlock is kart customizations which, if you're any sort of decent at mario kart, hardly matter much besides their looks.. Graphics are incredible, and there are a bunch of little details Nintendo added in that give this game the classic Nintendo feel with a bit of modernization.. The racing mechanics are fun and easy to master with a little practice, as long as you shut off the drive-assist which is enabled by default (why?).. Definitely brought back some good nostalgia, and I'm sure I'll play it... sometimes.. I love Nintendo- die-hard fan- but man, please give us something new!. There's very little replayability to the game. After beating each stage on 50, 100, and 150cc all I wanna do is scream ""what's new?"". The addition of link to the game was a welcome surprise and the hyrule themed map made me smile ear to ear. Please keep the switch alive with more great games, Nintendo!!",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.14763926024955437,0.4627346999405824
8,5.0,"Mario Kart 8 was a great game on the Wii U and it is still the best Mario Kart ever released.. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe brings all the fun of the original version plus adds a few more features to it.. The game looks as beautiful as ever, and runs smoothly. Perhaps even better than on Wii U due to the higher resolution supported by the new hardware.. Now, and this is probably the thing I like the most about it, is that we finally have a console-quality Mario Kart game to play on the go. While all the portable Mario Kart games have been good enough, the console versions have always been superior by far. The fact that we can fit the entire Mario Kart 8 experience in our pockets now is a reality feels surreal.. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe features all the tracks, characters, DLC and features from the orginal straight from the box. No unlocking... well actually scratch that, you do have to unlock the kart parts again. But all tracks and characters are ready to go from the start.. If you never played MK8, you can expect a great arcade racing game with all the crazy combat action you can expect from the series. There's a few things you need to know.. - Coins are back. Collect coins across the tracks to increase your max speed.. - New items such as the Boomerang and the Pirahna Plant.. - Antigrav mechanics, now you can ride your kart even on walls and upside down at certain sections.. - As in Mario Kart 7, vehicles can be customized. You can glide through the air and drive underwater as well.. - Mario Kart 8 for the first time in the series features cameo characters and tracks from other Nintendo games such as Zelda, Animal Crossing, Fzero, Excitebike and Splatoon.. - Go all the way from 50cc up to 200cc for the first time. Yes, it is crazy fast and makes the game a lot harder than you'd expect.. The Deluxe version brings a revamped Battle Mode that is actually fun to play, with the classic modes Coin Runners, Shine thieft, Balloon Battle, Bob Omb Blast and more. This definitely makes the experience feel more complete. It also brings back the ability to hold 2 items at the same time which hasn't been done since Gamecube's Mario Kart Double Dash.. I don't know if the existance of this port means that Switch won't get its' own proper MK9. Hopefully it still does. Right now this is too much deja vu for my liking. But I do love MK8 and while I was ready for something new at this point, I'm just happy I can take this excellent gem wherever I go.",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.19841215182124272,0.49459093095456724

0,4.0,"It's really fun if you know what settings to mess with, but if you want to get three stars on all the grand prix races then be prepared to smash your switch into the wall. The normal grand prix races are terrible, because they mixed far too many different elements in at the same time, and the items cause the most skilled players to end up in 5th or 6th on a good day. The more powerful items are impossible to use without flying off the course, and the items you get when in the lead are pathetic. On multiple occasions I've been in first place for all three laps on the hardest difficulty with the hardest cpus, and three seconds before I cross the finish line I'm hit with a blue shell, red shell, bomb, you name it, and I end up with a little ""Nice Try!"" message. The items are a balancing method to make the game ""fun for everyone"" when really it just throws any of your skill out the window. Also the items do not work with the courses, especially on 150 or 200cc, because the courses are much more complex and difficult to maneuver, and most of the items give speed boosts, which are entirely too fast for the course. I've played Mario Kart for nearly ten years, and it's disappointing that I can't absolutely demolish my friends at it like any other Mario Kart. So if you're like me and want to hone your skills on the new courses, just do VS and turn off the items.",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.06580492424242426,0.5346969696969696

If there are no little kids around, you can even make up tons of drinking games around Mario Kart as well!. If you prefer for the more serious route there are tons of challenges that you can take on, either through solo player or online against people all around the world which will really test your skills.

5,5.0,"Love it! The five stars almost don't feel like enough. Everything about this game is fun, and the challenges keep coming with new moods exclusive to the Nintendo Switch!. If you have ever played MarioKart before, this is more of the same - fast, fun, and never-ending excitement. I don't think your the person I need to sell on this.. If you have never played Mario Kart, and you have a Nintendo Switch...I mean, what are you waiting for??? Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is not just another racing game - you race underwater, through the skies, upside down, through a toybox; there is so much to see and do and learn here. Plus, there is a learning curve, and the game is designed to help you become a better racer gradually, while still letting you take home the Gold cup. Single player is great, and playing this on the go with the Switch is ideal because each race is never longer than 5 minutes total. You could easily power it up in the doctor's waiting room and probably finish a few Cups before being called back.. And the multiplayer is great! There are other features designed to help even the odds between veterans and new-comers. From the Grand Prix to the Battles, it's anyone's game to win! The online is much more challenging, but after completing all the 150cc cups with Gold, you should be set to take anyone on..

6,3.0,"This version of Mario Cart has great visuals and I liked all the new toys and power-ups(my last version was on the Wii). I also thought gliding off jumps was a fun new addition to the series. That being said, when I play this version of the game it just doesn't feel right. In older versions you could explore the edge of the map, and if you went the wrong way you ended up paying the price. This game feels like they left the training wheels on. When you get close to the edge of the track the game takes over control of your vehicle and points you back in the right direction. As it does this even before you leave the main track at times it leaves you feeling like you're not really in control. For young kids this probably makes the game less frustrating, but for me I felt like I was bowling with the gutter guards on. I wish this was an optional setting so my young boys could use it while I was free to succeed(or fail) on my own.. Hopefully I don't have to wait for the next Nintendo system for a better version of this game.",Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,0.03252937538651824,0.42608998144712446

One of the most enticing parts about purchasing this game is that is already comes with some new content, as well as the DLC from the WiiU version of Mario Kart 8. This is a great game to enjoy by yourself, with friends, with family, and will definitely keep children busy. The Joy-Cons that come with the switch act as two controllers, so you are already guaranteed to be able to have two people enjoy this game at the same time. I would recommend also investing in a Pro-Controller or second pair of Joy-Cons if you find playing the game with just one Joy Con difficult.

Perfect gameplay, great characters and balance, tracks, and a huge array of vehicles, wheels and gliders to choose from.. If I were to take from it, however, would be due to the fact that all characters, GP levels and tracks are available from the get go. A little challenge and unlocking helps a long way. Also, with that many characters, some feel forgettable.. Do not get me wrong - these are simply factors that I believe could provide an even better experience. Mario Kart at its finest.

One minute you're in 1st place perfectly drifting making Zero mistakes. Then bam you get hit by a blue shell, then another blue shell, then maybe a couple of red shells all in a row! You go from 1st, all the way to 5th even 10th all because of things out of your control. The better you race the worst items you get from randomized weapon boxes, meanwhile people in dead last are pumbling you with Shells and other items. I wish there was a game mode where Items weren't aloud aside from custom matches. The items make this game unplayable for me, I can't be competitive in a game that screws you for playing well. Seriously.......... what were they thinking with the items? I returned it I'll wait for the next Mario Cart that's more balanced because the weapon/item balancing in this game is atrocious and broken in my opinion.

There are a lot of confusing mechanics and options in the menu and the translation to english in the tutorials seems like there is something lost in translation.. Additionally, I got it for a party tonight, excited that there would be 74 fighters as advertised, but only 8 are available. Fighters are randomly unlocked by playing the game for hours. You might unlock 2 in 1 hour or play for 4 and unlock none. Plus you have no control of who gets unlocked. Excited to play as Snake or Bayonetta? Good luck. Literally. Unlocking them is just random luck. Kind of a shame for people that just want this as a party game and don't want to put in all the effort and time to unlock all the characters that were alluded to being available.

2,5.0,"My preorder from another store came Thursday afternoon, so I've been playing with my kids for about eight hours. It totally lives up to expectations. It's in no way perfect, but there's just so much good that I don't see how anybody can be sad. It's a game I'm going to be playing for years, and I'm going to enjoy it for years. If you're a parent, your kids will love playing with all their friends. If you're a returning player, all the nostalgia and great Smash gameplay is here. If you're new to Smash, this is a great game to play with other people.. When you first boot up, you'll have access to eight characters: Mario, DK, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Starfox, and Pikachu. Unlocks happen pretty quick, but we'll see how long it takes to unlock all 74 characters. I love some of the new costumes like the Mario Wedding costume. I read an online unlock guide that said if you quit the game after unlocking a character and play another quick round that you'll unlock lots of characters quickly. When I say quit the game I mean to exit the game on the Switch home menu. That's worked well so I did that for a while on my Switch to unlock quickly so I could play with lots of characters. I didn't tell my kids about this because I want unlocking on their Switch to be more organic and slower.. Lots of characters have pretty big differences in how they play and lots of characters have small differences and lots is the same. I don't even know what to tell you. Switching out pokemon with pokemon trainer is really fast. You can detonate Link's bombs remotely. The basic gameplay is the same so Smash fans will pick up on things really fast. I still think that Smash is the best game for fighting game beginners because the controls are very simple.. Gameplay is faster than the past few games. This can make battles more crazy. The only complaint about faster gameplay is that it's harder to keep up with both your character and everything else that's happening on the board. I've lost my character a number of times. I almost wish we could get an option for colored outlines for all the characters. I might just be out of practice, so we'll see if this is still an issue after a while.. Is it balanced? There are 74 characters--who knows! And since Smash for Wii U had balancing updates, this will be different in a year from now. I will say that the kids and I have fought with all sorts of characters and nobody's thought that any seemed overpowered. We're just barely starting to see the changes to characters and how new characters work and we're still unlocking characters. The Smash community will be finding things out for months and opinions are going to change over and over.. I love that you can save rulesets. You can customize the game heavily with more or less stuff. You can have lots of items or no items or specific items or more lives or change the Final Smash options. It's really cool to have all your quick pick favorites but at the same time making rulesets is a little slow. I feel that as I get rulesets made that I'll really like it. Today being new, I've really wanted to make a tweak between games and it's been kinda slow because of all the options available. We are a two switch family and it's going to be a pain to make all our rulesets twice. I really wish there was some way to bring rulesets with you.. I don't know how it could be done better, but the stage select is just one big picture of little tiny squares. It's almost too much. I wish there were an option to show you like 12 random stages rather than all of them. We've mostly played on random so far because it's overwhelming!. The graphics and animation takes a step up from the Wii U more than I thought it would. The stage graphics are awesome and there are so many new touches that are really cool. The N64 stages feel updated but classic. It runs very smoothly in tv mode and we've not played in handheld mode.. The music is awesome. There's just so much variety. It all sounds like it's made on a computer, but it's all really good music. I hear there are over 800 tracks.... Controls feel great. The joycons aren't the perfect smash controller. The thumbsticks can't keep up with a good player. The pro controller is better, but the gamecube controller just feels right. Maybe I'm nostalgic, but I'm really enjoying playing with the gamecube adapter. My daughters prefer the joycon because that's really the controller they know. My 11 year old son also likes the gamecube controllers (but I guess he could be feeding of my choice). If you're really serious about the game, I really suggest your getting the gamecube adapter. Mine that came with Super Smash Bros Wii U works great, but I see they're selling it separate now. It sold out quite a few times in the Wii U era, so you might want to pick one up now!. Local multiplayer is awesome. I think you can play with 8 players on every stage. We've had five people playing lots of battles and it's been a whole lot of fun. This is Smash Bros to us!. We don't play online, so I'm just ignoring that. I'm sure lots of people will be talking about how crappy it is or laggy or great or amazing or horrible. We play with family, with friends, with church youth, and with anyone around a TV.. World of light is the single player story mode. My first impression is that it's not as good as Sub-Space Emissary from Smash Brawl, but it looks like a decent way to play alone and unlock more stuff. Kinda like I don't play online, I don't play the story mode that much. My son is excited about it, so I'm glad it's here. I'll just let others who want story mode more review it better. Collecting spirits to affect your character and the stage seems really cool, but I hear that it just means that the uniqueness of the stages go away so all the stages seem the same. You will run into stages with fog. If you have a spirit badge that takes away fog, it just makes it another normal Smash battle. We'll see how fast it gets old for my son.. They've said there will paid and free DLC. Piranha Plant will be free DLC for early adopters and will be available early next year. There will be 5 paid DLC packs that each has 1 new fighter, one new stage, and music tracks. The first one will be a Persona 5 character! They haven't announced any others yet. These packs will be six dollars each or 25 for the set. They haven't set a date for the DLC but they've said all 5 packs will be available by 2020. I assume one will come every few months.. Overall, it's an awesome game. With the free Piranha Plant, you get 75 fighters to pick from. There are over 100 stages. There's just so much Smash. It plays great and it's a lot of fun. I totally suggest this!",Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch,0.184164384368466,0.4951076606688852

1,1.0,"I really wanted to like this game since I have been a fan since the N64 version but there are so many flaws I don't know how this happens to such a large name title from Nintendo. The biggest flaw is online which was a big selling point. It is AWFUL, Nintendo do still had not learned how to make a decent online game and is about 14 years behind everyone else, the bad coding mixed with horrible input lag makes the game sluggish. Why am I forced to pay for an online subscription when the game connects of a p2p network and every match is filled with lag to the point where it is not even enjoyable. Not to mention when you set your settings for 1v1 preferred matches you never get what you want and are then put into FFA lagfests. You can go to the arena mode but all that is just a waiting in line simulator when you have more than 2 people in a room. Why can you not switch your characters after a match?

2,5.0,"If you've played Smash Bros. since you got the n64 version, this game shows just how much the game has evolved. I am no means a ""pro"" when it comes to playing Smash Bros. but this game is the best I have played since it's first iteration.. Let this be a disclaimer for all the people who have never played a Smash Bros game before, this game is overwhelming and taking it all in is a task within itself. Look at it this way, you bought a Tesla on the sheer fact that it's an electric car, only to find it has so many features you have to read a manual, but when you finally grasp the aspects of the car the reward is tremendous! So my advise to you is to take in each feature, one by one, and indulge in each of it's aspects. What you will find is a deep and enriching gaming experience that captures what Nintendo is all about, and at the same time you will learn how to truly Smash... your opponent into oblivion.. Like most Smash Bros. enthusiast I loved melee, and deemed it the best of the the series as Brawl ruined my favorite character (fox) and other aspects of what Smash Bros is, but when the Wii U version came out, I loved that game because it was released on the 3DS and I can play Smash Bros. where ever I want when I want and it has an interesting mix of melee and brawl. Now we have Smash Bros. Ultimate and it's on the switch, it's portable like the 3DS version, it looks amazing graphically, and it leans more towards Melee in terms of its gameplay and speed but not so much that it's hard to pick up and play. In other words, it's has the best aspects of the series in a amazing package and did I mention that the switch makes it portable :).. In short, this game is a must have. There is 100's of hours of game play in a small cartridge and is worth your time to invest. Again, if you don't have time, it's portable so you can indulge when ever and where ever you want in what could possibly be, the best switch game yet!",Super Smash Bros.

7,4.0,"Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the ""Ultimate"" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word ""ultimate"" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.. Part 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The ""how to play"" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.. Part 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long. And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.. Part 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard ""Smash"" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called ""squad strike"" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a ""squad"" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode ""special"" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have ""Spirits mode"", which houses this game's campaign mode, ""World of Light"". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting ""trophies"" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of ""Spirits mode"" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters. So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you ""equip"" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember ""stickers"", which are almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of ""spirits"" is fully brought into play in the ""World of Light"" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named ""Galeem"" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you ""skill points"" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with ""World of Light"" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in ""Smash mode"". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have ""Classic Mode"", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the ""classic"" modes we're used to. And by ""different"", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were ""break the targets"" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over. And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.. **SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the ""For fun"" and ""For Glory"" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.. Part 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like ""Break the Targets"", ""board the platforms"" and ""Home run contest"" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like ""All-star"" and ""event match"" are absent.. UPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.. Lastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the ""World of Light"" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.. Part 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,""break the targets"" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, ""Classic"" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.",Super Smash Bros.

8,3.0,"I just want to frontload my review with this: I'm over 40, a father, and have never played another Super Smash Bros. game. I've played older fighting games, like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, and know the gist of how they work. I've played and enjoyed Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Super Mario Kart 8 on the Switch very much.. The good: The backgrounds on this game are extremely well-done. They can been a little confusing at times, as they move and drop you into new settings during a match, but that is easy enough to avoid, if you wish. Fun if you're solely into button-mashing, with no strategy involved.. The bad: The only way to figure out the game menus is to have played the game before. There is no reason for the navigation to be so complicated. Unfortunately this makes the game much more tedious than it needs to be.",Super Smash Bros.

9,5.0,"To get started this review will be aimed towards veterans, I will not be explaining what SSB is or how to play it. I will only go over what is different this time around so hold on to your seat. First things first, Here‚Äôs a pro tip for any Meta Knight mains, I need you to scroll to the top of the page, close Amazon and go back to For Honor where you obviously main Orochi (pls give Like if you got the joke) but really though. The first thing you want to do is go right into spirits mode, because you only get 8 or so characters to start. Any character you unlock in spirits mode will automatically join you in regular smash, however any character you unlock by triggering the ‚ÄúA new challenger appears‚Äù fight, will not be added to spirts. The best way I can describe this mode is a mix between Pokemon and Mario party, you and your opponents can equip spirits (that have replaced trophies) that can give you boosts like, improved jumps, stronger attacks, fire resistance, etc. And the ultimate goal is to equip spirits that counter your opponent‚Äôs. Although once you have your favorites leveled up enough it‚Äôs possible to just tank your way throughout most of the battles. Except for a few annoying ones. And get comfortable because this mode took me 15 hours to complete with only a 80% completion rate. I suggest you tough it out because the final act really makes the grind worth it.. The entire Game has received minor graphical upgrades, as for the fighters themselves, all have obtained animation tweaks that give them more personality overall, Mario has a cooler down smash, Zelda has a new costume and can now throw energy beams with his sword at full health (A little inside joke for the Nintendo vets) Every part of the game really makes it feel like they put they‚Äôre heart and soul into it. The amount of content packed in here is astounding. Even the settings/rules you‚Äôre allowed to play with can be overwhelming at times, but don‚Äôt worry, you can save and name your custom rules so you can get back into the action quicker. Also be sure to take advantage of the ability to pick 2 stages and morph between them. Home run contest and target practice are gone, Because they had to save space somehow. But Here‚Äôs the real tragedy. I think all of us veterans know that picking the right color makes us play better, and some alternative colors where cut. Are they really expecting us Mario mains to go online and fight those Malakas Meta Knight mains without his fire flower outfit?! (AC fans where you at?) in all seriousness though, this game is a love letter too all the Smash fans that have been with this franchise throughout the years. Do yourself a favor. Buy this game and good luck online.. If you enjoyed this review be sure to like, comment, and subscribe!. Update; So they added 2 new DLC characters, Piranha Plant and Joker from Persona 5. Look up gsmVoiD to get in-depth look at both characters. And be sure to use P Plant‚Äôs neutral Special attack on opponents trying to get back on the stage if you like cultivating salt in amounts that the world has never seen. Also be sure to hit the bell icon to be updated all that is SSBU.",Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch,0.15685145792904415,0.5063711671470292
0,2.0,"The only place this game shines is as a couch game with friends. There's a world of fun customization options for you and your friends to dive into. Beyond that, the fun stops. There are a number of World of Light fights that I'm pretty sure were never actually tested. They're completely unfun, and you spend your time praying for good RNG or broken AI instead of actually fighting. The online matchmaking is awful, and you're often put into rulesets you didn't ask for. And the overall character balance leaves a bit to be desired. Great that you included so many characters in the game, but you're essentially throwing all hopes of ever balancing it out the window. Is that really worth the tradeoff?.

2,5.0,"As a person who has been riding the hype train for Smash Ultimate, I was NOT disappointed in the slightest when I began to play it. There is just so much content in this game that I can already see myself having 100+ hours in it. I'm making this review because there was some concerns that I read in some other reviews and I want to point out some things.. There was a review that talked about how you start off with 8 characters and how it was not advertised above. Although I cannot confirm the second statement as I did not read it, starting with 8 characters is true. The truth is, this game's 72 characters are unlocked every 10 minutes which if you do the math means a seriously long time. How to fix this? Play a match with 20 minutes facing any CPU on any stage with a lot of room. Once done you should see a new challenger. Beat them and exit out the game. Re-enter in the game and play again only this time with one live and self destruct at the start of a match. You should get another challenger. Rinse and repeat until you get all the characters and if it doesnt pop up anymore, redo the first method and follow the same progress. I have used this method and unlocked 53 characters and I could have done more if my switch didnt die or I wanted to eat. (I searched and found that I only played this game for 6 hours in my profile).. One review said that it doesnt teach you how to play the game which is completely 1000000% false. When you enter in the game on the smash ultimate logo, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING. A video pops up to tell you how to play that any child can learn from.. This review is already super long so I'll end this by stating that there are ALREADY videos on how to find things on the menu, unlock things, and many others. If you are complaining here without even doing your research then clearly you arent doing your homework.. I recommend watching a Youtuber called ""Zerowondering"" who was ranked the best player in Smash Wii U/3DS and posts videos on how to do ""this and that"" in Ultimate. Be sure to tell him that I sent you lol. Alright. This ends my review! GO PLAY SOME ULTIMATE!!!",Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch,0.05874458874458873,0.517907647907648

4,3.0,"Pros:. + Large roster of 75 fighters at launch.. + Huge list of 103 stages.. + ENORMOUS catalog of music. The audio in this game is INSANE! I've never seen a game with so much musical variety on top of all new voice acting and sound effects.. + Many franchises represented with fighters, stages, music, spirits, and challenges. Where else can you throw a Pokeball at Mario and Sonic while playing as Samus on a stage resembling Midgar?. + Chrom, Incineroar, and King K. Rool are excellent picks for new characters. There are other new characters.. + Very fun to play with a lot of friends! 8 player Smash on a projection screen is still a blast!. + Multiple control options. Use Joy-Cons, Pro Controllers, or Gamecube controllers.. + Everyone can play Smash Bros. Adults, kids, and even non-gamers can play the game. Easy to learn; difficult to master.. + Very flexible fight system. Deep customization options for player handicaps, fighter balancing, stage hazard control, item frequency, teams, and more. More options than previous games.. In-Betweens:. o All fighters can now be unlocked thanks to patch 1.2. Previously it was near-impossible for a non-competitive or casual player to unlock all the fighters due to super-aggressive AI.. o Online play is smooth and tries to respect your preferences. Prior to patch 1.2, the online was laggy and would put you in matches you didn't want to play.. o Nintendo seems very disconnected from their players. They don't seem to be able to interact with casual Smash fans without sending the hyper-competitive group into a meltdown.. Cons:. - ""Everyone is here"" is not actually true! Charizard is not a standalone fighter anymore and has been tied back to Pokemon Trainer. Nintendo really should release a patch that gives the option to play Charizard standalone again. Being forced over to Squirtle upon KO is a problem. The competitive player argument that Charizard was always intended to be part of Pokemon trainer does not satisfy the casual crowd. It was fun to play standalone Charizard! Nintendo, please fix!. - Gatekeeping online community of hyper-competitive players who care more about tier lists and frames than fun. Very difficult to get Nintendo to pay attention to genuine problems when the elite players are constantly screaming for nerfs and more difficulty while suppressing everyone else.. - Starting roster is only the original 8 fighters from the N64 days. You must unlock 67 other fighters. Ridiculous! Takes a long time to unlock all fighters even when using workarounds. Not acceptable in a full priced game.. - Adventure mode is highly repetitive. It could have used some side-scrolling, beat-em-up levels like mini-Subspace Emissary or Smash Run experiences. It can take a long time to unlock new fighters in adventure mode.. - Some features are missing. No stage builder, home run contest, target smash, and some other classics. Not a huge loss, but still curiously absent staples of the franchise.. - Online system does a terrible job of separating competitive players from casual players.. - No Miiverse doodle fun.. I've owned every Smash game since the original N64 game. Smash can be a fun game to play with your friends if everyone chills out. Smash Ultimate feels like a step forward in some ways, and a step back in other ways. At launch, Smash Ultimate felt too focused on the competitive players. After patch 1.2, Nintendo has made some adjustments for the casual crowd and earned a star. The jury is still out as to if Smash Ultimate is more about fun or more about competition. I need to see some of the cons addressed before I increase the star rating for this product again. Good game, but could be so much more!",Super Smash Bros.

5,1.0,I was so excited to play this game because I had never played it before and I heard great things about it. I had also just purchased my switch and this was one of the first games I purchased for it. I went to open it and noticed that the plastic wrapping around it was a little bit loose but I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it. I opened the box and saw nothing. There was no game in it. I looked online to see if this has happened to anyone else and apparently it does happen a lot. I immediately started the refund/return process and sent it back ASAP.

6,3.0,"This is the first time I‚Äôve ever played any version of Super Smash bro's. It‚Äôs loud, it‚Äôs flashy, it has great music, but has no instructions $^!*@#^!! I spent the first 15 minutes just trying to open a battle, then got destroyed for the next 30 minutes while I helplessly mashed any key I could. One hour and 10+ Google searches later, I was just trying to figure out how to open training mode. Was there a training mode? Thankfully yes. There is a training mode hidden here in a place you wouldn't think to look.. After another hour trying to figure out how to do moves (the game only gives you instructions 5 moves.) The rest you kind of have to figure out on your own. I still have no idea how the spirits are used (are they just aura buffs?) and how much each level improves my character? Where are the stats? Why are there 2 spirits? Are there other special moves not listed on those 5 moves? Where can I find them? I use game suggested spirits because there is no darn manual to explain! Why can my damage go above 100%? How do I do a ‚Äúfinal smash?‚Äù What the heck is a ‚Äúfinal smash?‚Äù Why does Kirby change after eating an opponent? How do I revert back? What is the buff he gets? It is incredibly frustrating for first time players. I played fighting all my life and this is the first I‚Äôve had so much trouble with.. I gifted a copy of the game to my 8-year old nephew on Wednesday, and called me crying in frustration this morning letting me know he still can‚Äôt figure out how to get past the initial menus screens.. I feel Nintendo let their ""new players"" with a short rope, banking all the ""veteran players"" who knew the game would know what to do. What about the rest of us? The game play looks fun, but there are no instruction on how to reach that level of knowledge to enjoy it at its full potential.

8,5.0,"It's easy to be bitter over the minutiae of what's missing, what's different, etc. But the fact is, this is undeniably the best total Smash Bros package to date. It's massive, it's superbly polished, and it's seemingly boundless in its content. The first couple of days with this game have taken me back to the sentiments I had when first experiencing Melee on the GameCube, and that's a phenomenon I haven't enjoyed since 2001. I'm 36, and it's like I'm a kid again.. The best aspects of the series have been distilled down to what initially seems almost certainly the best-balanced installment to date. The action is swift, the characters and stages are seemingly neverending, and the music... 850 songs spanning dozens of franchises from different companies in gaming history. Unreal.. Here's hoping the online wrinkles get ironed out to where matches prioritize connection quality over brevity of the waiting period.

9,5.0,"Pros:. The World of Light adventure mode is fantastic. Not only is it really fun to play with the addition of a progression system with the spirits, skill tree, and unlocking more fighters, but it also quite long and will take you many hours to fully play through. I actually quite enjoyed the spirit system and the many different spirit fights seem diverse enough that it doesn't really start to bore me. Maybe the only problem is the varied difficulty of fights. Most fights are insanely easy after you have a decent full leveled spirit, even on the highest difficulty, but you can always purposefully handicap yourself by using a weaker spirit if that's your thing. But also some of the fights were so insanely difficult and unfair that switching down to ""easy"" mode still made the fight take me 30 minutes of replaying to beat (and I'm pretty decent at the game). Honestly it wasn't even a downside for me I enjoyed the challenge and it wasn't a necessary fight for progressing.. Huge character pool this time around. ""Everyone is here!"" Not an exaggeration over 80 characters will be on the roster after dlc and counting Pokemon trainer as multiple fighters. Obviously some of those are just slightly different echo fighters, but the diversity is still great. Just quick unlocking characters by restarting, unlocking, and restarting again took a long time. All the characters look great and feel great to play and play vs, though I haven't been able to use all of the extensively yet.. I'm not a pro player by any stretch, but the fighting mechanics feel fluid and the engine seems well polished. I love that the heavy characters have been buffed by having their lag time for aerials and landing reduced. I like them making perfect shield harder/different as it will give pros something to develop skill wise as well. Hopefully the pro scene will be able to make something of this game as smash 4 was a bit of a let down (won't even talk about brawl).. They also made training mode better, and allow you to play the game while waiting for an online match, but many other parts of online are less than desirable.. Cons:. Online mode is kind of taking a back seat here. I was really hoping we would be getting a more fine tuned and more competition oriented online mode, but got the opposite. They made online mode a for fun system, which I understand is the direction Sakurai wants to take with the game, but I just don't understand why they couldn't have given their competitive community a bone here. Online match making no longer has a For Glory mode. There is simply casual mode with a matchmaking system that puts you up against someone near your skill level based on an elo system on a per fighter basis. It also matches you with some with a game rule similar to your own, but not exact.... this has made me go into what I thought was a 1v1 no items match into an assist trophy free for all nightmare. This is also going to continue to create debates as to what the ""official"" competitive rule set will be for 1v1 online play.. Overall the game is a great experience and was definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait. Tons of replayablity and fun for all levels of players.",Super Smash Bros.

2,2.0,"The latency in this game made it a trashfire for me personally. Yeah I'm coming from a melee background. And if you tell me I'm spoiled I'll tell you that things should get better not worse and you're the reason searching for a movie on amazon and netflix sucks. Because scrolling to a file in an alphabetically list and clicking it which takes 2 seconds was somehow, to you, less preferable than taking 7 minutes to get your tv remote to painstakingly land on Twilight on your streaming services when you were actually trying for Titanic. Admit it, the Apple spearheaded gaudy-square ui that infects everything now was more preferable to your lazy narcissism than selecting from simple raw data and that's why we're all doomed. That's why capitalism is allowed to take away user's right to easily perform maintenance on their own devices. They distracted you with an Idiocracy level ui where you can push pretty buttons and you gave up the entire logic center of your brain with no complaint.. ANYWAY I have beef with a bunch of Ultimate. Here's a main one: Screwing with the screen in 50 different ways during play is not a game mechanic. It's bad game design and there's no way to avoid it in the single player. You limit who you play with when you have to set flags for ""yeah stop putting an insulting giant dog graphic over the screen when people are playing and calling it a feature."" Single player is especially heinous with this crap.. Online is toxic of course. People just troll or kill themselves over and over when they die once and it apparently bans you for 30 minutes when you do that. When that happens I'm mostly like ""yay I get to stop playing."" Nintendo failed to balance their way out of metas so you're always going to have 50 Peaches spamming the butt attack one week and I dunno...Kirby doing some pink auto-win nipple dance the next.

9,3.0,"Its Smash with all that fine tuned perfection lurking just beneath all that chaos... only now we have literally every character ever with a roster that is still growing to this day.. All that it presents you is 11/19 glory.. ...yet I want to rate it 3/5 stars for the mind bogglingly stupid missteps it made.. 1: Petty gripe this may be, the roster is organized by order of appearance in the Smash franchise rather than which franchise they're from and has no means of editing its arrangement... not a big issue for fighters with a dozen or two characters, but with 75+ characters in this roster in a handheld screen... the Needle in a haystack game becomes more annoying than not.. 2: The big gripe... They removed AI from online battles. If me and my Scottish buddies want to play we are limited purely to human v human. Some of my favorite times were pitting my friends and I against beefed up max level comps. No idea why they cut such a vital function from the game but now half my friends who played it are no longer interested.. 3: Also in the vein of what you can do offline versus online.... The Smash Roster matches are awesome in person and for some inexplicable reason they dont have the function online. Offline you can set up highly customer versus matches, making players metal, large, small, fast, slow, etc that again does not exist in online private matches..

0,5.0,"Just got this game on my first switch lite, and only played the long single player campaign, which was actually pretty cool, but difficult at times. I really enjoyed it, even though it was extremely tedious, doing the same battles over and over and over again. What saves the single player is the great music in the overworlds and getting to listen to the dozens of stage music tracks and playing on a ton of awesome stages before heading in to multiplayer.. Also, single player is great for practicing before getting into online, because I have never played a smash game in my life until this one! I wasn't into N64 anymore when Playstation came out so I never played the original smash bros.. But, this is a great couch/party game with chaotic action.

1,5.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself. This is easily the only reason I bought a Nintendo Switch initially (I recently received a few Switch games for Christmas as well).. The game is incredibly fun. The Adventure mode takes you around a huge map where you collect 'spirits' that aid you in battle while you unlock your main fighting characters who have been trapped by evil. When you think the Adventure Mode over and you beat the game - guess again. You'll see what I'm talking about!. I ended up beating it and finishing at 99.02% completion. I played it on 'normal' difficulty. If its too easy or hard, you can switch difficulty as well. For the entire Adventure board and 99.02% completion, it took me just under 30 hours of game play. You will definitely get your money's worth.. There's also a 'spirit' mode where you just conduct battles to gather spirits. They cycle out every 5 minutes or so. It's great to collect any spirits you've missed as last I checked, there's over 1,200 in the game and there's been updates to continually add more.. Smash Online is fun to battle in multiplayer. There's different settings you can do from lives, items, maps, etc. that you can set so you're placed in a game that you want to be in. My biggest complaint with online play though is that the servers are extremely laggy. If one person in the match has a bad connection / slow internet / etc, then everyone suffers with lag and stuttering. I am not sure if this is a Nintendo server issue or a Brawl server issue, but its pretty frustrating. Other than that and if you're placed in a good server and people with good connections, its a load of fun and challenging if you're paired with other experienced Smash players.. Overall, a great game. Its definitely worth purchasing.",Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch,0.02310606060606061,0.5236111111111111
2,5.0,"Let's face it. You didnt buy the switch because of legend of zelda, mario odyssey, splatoon, mario kart, or pokemon. You bought the switch because once you saw the the Smash Bros first trailer you could feel your inner child screaming at the top of its lungs.. How to describe this game? Imagine taking the wiiu (3ds) smash bros, balancing some character attacks and adding melee (gamecube) tactics into the mesh. Oh, and then put every character ever made for smash bros into the fighting roster while adding 4 new characters totalling 74 playable characters. Let's top it off by saying theres no locked characters behind a pay wall. The CEO of capcom could take notes from this practice to rebuild its fanbase from previous titles while having characters associated in smash.. Without giving away too much I'd highly recommend this to all smash fans as well as newcomers that want a step different from racing and shooting.

3,5.0,"I've been playing Smash Bros. since the N64 days and it's been great watching the evolution of the franchise. There have been stepbacks, especially with Brawl, but each iteration brings something new and unique to the playing field. Smash Ultimate is more than that as it brings most of everything from all Smash games and THEN some.. Technically, this game is gorgeous to play on a big screen and portable mode and 99.9% of the time, runs at a stable 60fps. Lag inputs are somewhat of an issue compared to older titles, but it's something I've gotten used to (still hoping for a patch).. Speaking of input, the mechanics of this title are fluid and tight with each character feeling unique in their own movesets. There are so many characters to choose from and the promise of even more is mindblowing. It's almost impossible to buy this game, play it, and not find a character you stick to.. But the real star of this show are the gamemodes, specifically the Adventure mode. World of Light has some great battles and good challenges for those looking for one, but it's extremely lengthy. My 100% playthrough of the adventure mode on hard clocked in at over 40 hours. Of course, your mileage may vary, but expect a long time grinding. Other modes, like classic and multi-man smash are also great fun, with challenges encouraging you to pull off some crazy, insane feats.. But, when it comes down to just playing Smash by yourself or friends, this is the ULTIMATE package. I haven't tried the online yet, so I don't have an opinion on that, though I have heard some negatives. Either way, your $60 or whatever price you pay will not be wasted, rest assured..

You'll keep playing and wonder why.. Second, if you want it to suck just a little bit less--and I do mean just a LITTLE bit less--you have to buy an ADDITIONAL piece of equipment (USB-to-Ethernet adapter). Even then, it still sucks. You'll Google why it still sucks and be told by internet strangers that it's still somehow your fault. Ok. They don't have a problem. It's only you. You should stop using WiFi. You should get better internet. You should move to Japan.. Third, you have to pay for online. That's right. You have to PAY someone MONEY in order to GET the worst online experience in your life.

6,3.0,"Solid game. Many great characters and counting. Negatives would be the lack of any non-fighting mode. Was hoping for another Home Run mode at least. I would've preferred they work on incorporating a non-fighting minigame than add more characters to this already great roster I haven't even played all the characters with yet. Was very disappointed after beating the World of Light to find there was nothing else to do but fight in every other game mode. Also the World of Light has steep variances in difficulty. I had to switch to easy to beat certain spirits, but switch to medium or hard to get a decent challenge out of the unlockable fighters and boss battles.. Pros. - Large array of characters.. - Long story mode that requires you to think a little. Cons. - All game modes revolve around fighting. - No cool minigames. - World of Light has steep variances in difficulties due to spirit abilities/conditions. - No ability to lower difficulty in Spirit Board.

Better gameplay then Super Smash Brother Brawl and I would rank it as this almost the same game play as Super Smash Brothers U. Out of Super Smash Brothers games, it's easily my favorite besides The Golden Child of Super Smash Brothers Melee. My real issue with this game comes to what they didn't give us. It's is a small complaint. I'm really sad that we didn't get a home run contest or break the targets. I miss the trophies that you would get and how you could spend time just looking at them. I get why they're not in there. This game is huge. I like that they put in a story mode. Then again I also wish it was more like brawl when it came down to that story mode.

It drifts up and the joystick doesn't respond properly. This makes it extremely difficult to do anything, really.

They told me they would replace it if i sent it back but I never went through with the process because even though the gimpy joycon barely worked, I didn't want to be without a controller for however long it would've taken.

The controllers feel solid and their utility as potentially two controllers helps justify the high price tag. The joy-con joysticks do not feel as sturdy as Nintendo controllers past, I've already had the side of one fold a bit when placed in a case incorrectly, and when I folded it back down over the top of the stick it left a permanent set of bumps on the nib. No issues other than that and they do feel solidly built. The matte colors are great, it's a shame the bumper guards do not correspond, nor that the buttons have any color scheme to match.

Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should've gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once. Nintendo did not charge me anything to send them for repairs because each time they claimed nothing was wrong with them & the very same Joy-Cons would be returned to me. Lo & behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I've heard people say the size of these controllers aren't bothersome or small. I've also heard people say they're much too small, & I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding & playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I don't know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails.

9,5.0,"I have both a Nintendo joycon and a pro controller. I really enjoy the joycon as it can be split into two seperate controllers and be used by two seperate people, I think its extremely innovative. The rumble features in my opinion are on par with Sony and I have found the motion controllers to be very cool myself.. However, buyers should be aware this product does not come with a grip (essentially the piece that holds the two joycon in one controller frame). It's just the two individual pieces not attached. The grip is approximately an extra 15 bucks.. In addition these controllers are likely in addition to the pair that comes with the switch. These controllers do need to charge and the only way to do so is to have them attached to the switch console itself, which means you cant also charge the joycon that came boxed with the switch at the same time without another product.. If you're going to buy the extra joycon I would recommend either a charging grip (which can be plugged in via USB- c to a wall charger or a charge station..

0,2.0,"I ordered this for two reasons:. 1 - The colors. They're perfect and fit my aesthetics well. I really do love how vibrant they are so that gets a 5/5.. 2 - My original Red and blue pair started having the Nintendo Drift (TM) problem. For those not aware: Nintendo Joy Cons will eventually develop an issue where the thumbstick will detect movement when there is no movement of the thumbstick. This is supposedly (according to the internet) due to debris getting under the thumbstick and causing a detection error. There's a lot of DIY solutions from blowing compressed air into the seam of the thumbstick to applying WD-40 or Acetone or Rubbing Alcohol under there. But since I wanted to get this color set I figure I'd bite the bullet and buy this set.. Now supposedly, Nintendo is SO aware of this issue they will repair JoyCons for free and have since the release of the Switch made adjustments to the JoyCons. Apparently this particular model was not part of the adjustment lot. After playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons for about 6 hours I started to experience the drift with these. I ended up using the compressed air trick which... works about 20% of the time.. The real kicker? Due to COVID-19, Nintendo's repair service isn't available until further notice. Bad time for my joycons to be having this problem, huh? Even worse yet is that there's a risk that if I send these in, I may not get them back! I may end up with a standard gray or Neon Red and Neon Blue pair! Which defeats the purpose..

Weeks after, the tiny notch of plastic that attaches them to the system was wore down. We bought these to replace them. Weeks after and one of the new controllers did the same thing.

2,1.0,"I bought an extra set of Joy-cons in October because I wanted to play Mario Party with some friends. They worked great when I first got them, but that has changed.. After Smash Ultimate released, this is all I seem to play. Having an extra set of joy-cons allowed me to play against my friends who didn't have a set of their own, which was really nice. Until I started noticing some weird things were happening. When playing the game, my character would perform a different move than I wanted, they either would perform an up-special (recovery) when I wanted a neutral special, or would perform a neutral special when I wanted a down special (often causing my character to not counter when I wanted). At first I blamed it on myself just miss inputting what I wanted, but it got more severe. Then I noticed while on the menus the icon would constantly move up, making it hard to select what I wanted.. I tried playing in spite, of these issues, but up until this point the problem only existed in the left joy-con. Recently the right joy-con has been acting faulty as well. It would just not register button presses, leaving me repeatedly pressing the same button over and over again to try and make one thing happen. I have tried re-calibrating both the control stick on the left joy-con and the buttons on the right joy-con, but this has not worked.. What I find strange is that this is happening to my relatively new set of joy-cons. The pair I got with my switch still work great. The most irritating part of this is that these problems only started occurring shortly after the 90-days warranty expired. I take extremely good care of all of my video gaming equipment, so it is not me who has damaged them. If I had to guess I'd say a circuit component, like a resistor or capacitor, has burned out on the pcb's inside the joy-cons which would not be Nintendo's fault necessarily, but I expect better quality control of the components they are making their products out of. If the joy-cons had lasted over a year before acting up I would just attribute the problems to age and but a new pair, but with this happening only after a few months of use I refuse to but another pair seeing as they cost around $70.. Words of advice, be very careful on what you order. Products that don't last long are not worth the money. I have high standards for Nintendo products seeing as I have an original NES that still works beautifully, but this is ridiculous. I had considered purchasing a pro controller in the past, but if I have to risk it breaking after just a few months of use like these joy-cons, there is no way I am going to fork out the money to buy one.",Nintendo Joy-Con (L/R) - Gray,0.1138005772005772,0.5051405483405484

It is well built and functions well with my switch console. My daughters favorite color is blue but I love the fun colors and different options you can get.

4,1.0,"What to expect: only a few months of use, bought these to replace my original blue and red controllers that had drift, these came fine, although they didn‚Äôt feel like 80 dollar controllers. Felt less expensive than the wii remote.. I always keep my Nintendo switch in a nice area, where it‚Äôs safe, I wipe it down often and don‚Äôt play and eat at the same time and have kept careful consideration into its fragility, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the Amazon 3rd party‚Äôs fault. But if I buy a product I expect it to work.. Only a few days ago my joy con had a small ‚Äúbent‚Äù in it, I don‚Äôt know how it started, it was like a tiny dot at first. And then it had loosened the controllers padding, and as you can see by the picture, it fell off. well fell off little by little as the rubber slowly started peeling day by day, and one it was hanging on to the stick by a literal thread I finally decided to remove it (greatly impaired the ability to use it as my thumb would slide the analog stick and it‚Äôs rubber button around while it was falling off) and now it looks like that.. I have literally seen nothing like this happen to my other consoles, including Xbox and PlayStation controllers that cost thirty dollars or less to buy per controller, and that are from the early 2000‚Äôs nonetheless. Before my controllers padding slid off I noticed it looked like it was being held on by a cheap glue looking substance, or something of the equivalent. Being severely inexperience I have no idea how to fix this, I can‚Äôt just put it back on the controller, as it may just cause other issues/ wasn‚Äôt working when I tried at least.. But without insulation I would expect it to now break within a few coming months as a series of holes exposed for dust and other small particles to get inside and ruin it once more. As well as it‚Äôs now uncomfortable to use in its current condition. Even with the utmost care the controllers can‚Äôt stand on their own legs, especially for the average consumers knowledge.. There‚Äôs not even new controllers to buy at the store, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to buy them anyways. Would rather pay for alternative ‚ÄúKnock off‚Äù controllers that work better than Nintendo‚Äôs, or at least are the equivalent for half the price.

8,2.0,"These started out great, and were mostly okay for a few months. However, the drift got worse until they are now unusable. Specifically, the left controller drifts to the left (the right one is fine!). This means that whatever game you play, it's like an invisible friend just constantly pushing your stick to the left. One solution is to ""recalibrate"" from the Switch settings menu, but this does not seem to work for me. In the image above, you can see in the calibration menu that the controller is registering a hard push to the left even though the control stick is not being touched.. This seems to be a common problem, as the joy cons that came with the Switch originally also suffer the same issue (again, only the left one). I've ordered some cheap (relatively) knock off joycons, will see how those will do. Certainly cannot be worse, as this problem makes the joycons completely unusable..

The joy-con SUCKS!. We have the blue and red joy-cons which came with the Switch. I bought the Pink & Green joy-cons so we could play Mario Party (which we LOVE). Initially, we had no problems with the controllers. I was not impressed with the range, but whatever. Also, the delay while playing wirelessly is pitiable. If you are playing any game which requires timed button presses (Mario Party, Smash Bro's, Hollow Knight...) you cannot depend on accuracy, which is downright silly. Latency is not an issue for any other system's controllers.. Now, I've got a blue controller which won't hold a charge, a pink controller who's ""L"" button doesn't register and my green controller's ""X"" button sticks. Perhaps these issues are from maltreatment. I do have three kids. But I was their age when I got my NES and I abused the heck out of those controllers and they STILL work today!. I want to love the Joy-cons. They're adorable. The ability to switch between two and one controller play is a great feat in system engineering. The Switch system itself is a GREAT system.

I remap the shooting button to ""R"", we were playing and then I felt a plock on the button, and then it was working fine, but when shacking the controller, something was lose inside, I live outside the US (my sister took the controllers to me on a visit) so sending the controllers back to get them replaced was going to be more expensive than get new ones, but still getting new ones would be also expensive because have a couple of joycons that I got without use, so I decide to open them up and check what was going on.. What I found was a bolt got lose inside, is was one of the bolt just below the ""R"" button, I said well no problem just putting it back and that should be all.. Well nope, the place where you screw the bolt in is plastic and was striped, it seems that the bolt was over screwed, so the part was not grabbing the bolt, and that was with the other bolt as well. So even tho I screw them it wont take none of the 2 bolts and they were going to be wobbling around the controller sooner or later..

9,4.0,"I bought this set of Joy-cons for a few reasons - 1, to get an extra set of Joy-cons to use with the Switch, and 2, to hopefully solve a problem that I was having with the original Blue and Red/Orange Joy-cons that came with my Switch. When I would hold the Switch by the edges and try to play games on my Switch in that portable mode I would keep seeing problems with the connection between the left Joy-con and the Switch (console). As the connection on the left ""flexed"" the Joy-con on the left would think it was needing to be used in wireless mode vs. in directly attached to the Switch. Switching to this set of Joy-cons seemed to have fixed that issue, helping me to track the issue back to the problem being on the original left-side Joy-con.. I still have issues with the size of the buttons on the Joy-cons and wish that the buttons were bigger. I saw a Left Joy-con that was meant for a specific game (or sold for use with a specific game) that offered up a nice D-pad type button that I was salivating over. I liked the size of the button on there and would love a set of Joy-cons that had bigger buttons on both the left and right Joy-con so it was easier on more adult-sized fingers.. Other than that issue, there's also of course the issue of the cost of these items. They still seem too spendy to me. I'd love to see these come down a good bit, but of course that isn't terribly likely to happen for now.. 4 solid stars from this reviewer.",Nintendo Joy-Con (L/R) - Gray,0.11183862433862433,0.36165343915343917

1,5.0,"I've got fast internet and strong wifi but wifi is still wifi--it is slightly slower and subject to interference, and thus dropouts.. Given that the Switch has a locked OS there are limited tools we have to prove the worth of an adapter like this. Here is what I can say:. - Download speeds are considerably faster over a Cat 6 cable to an Apple Airport Extreme to Verizon FiOS. - Upload speeds are the same. - I haven't found a way to test ping times so I don't know how much those have improved (if they have improved at all). - I haven't been disconnected from any Splatoon 2 matches since installing a month ago. Typically over wifi I'd get dropped mid-match about once or twice a month. - I have still been 'unable to connect' when initiating matches, though as I understand it this has more to do with others' poor connections than mine. - This has not made my reflexes any faster :-(.

2,5.0,"A while ago I purchased this item, the Nintendo Switch Wired Internet LAN Adapter by HORI (Officially Licensed by Nintendo) .. and I must say that thus far I am very satisfied with it!. I bought this Wired Internet LAN Adapter in the hopes that it would provide a more stable internet connection for my Nintendo Switch (while it is withinn the Dock).. in addition to the standard Wi-Fi connection that I typically use (whenever my Switch in not Docked).. So far it seems to work just fine!. In case you don't know, this process basically works pretty much as expected: As long as my Nintendo Switch is within the Dock (and thus connected to my TV) the Wired Internet LAN Adapter is used to connect it to the internet.. But as soon as I remove my Switch from the Dock (using the Switch as a handheld device).. the active internet connection automatically switches over to my Wi-Fi connection.. And of course whenever I place my Switch back into the Dock.. The Wired internet connection becomes active once again.. The Wired Internet LAN Adapter was also very easy to connect to my Nintendo Switch console. The adapter simply plugs into the blue USB connector on the Dock..

3,5.0,"I don't know what people are talking about when they say that this doesn't support faster speeds. I suspect that the issue has to do with multiple devices in the home network (multiple routers etc) or with their ISP, but on my isp, I have about 90 Mbps down and pretty fast up from the direct modem connection. That's for my desktops, laptops, mobile devices etc as well even when they go through the wireless router I have.. On my switch, I got 95.6 Mbps down and 9.2 Mbps up. Here is a photo of the test.. As you can see, there is no SSID information. That is because this is through the LAN adapter and Ethernet cable.. Make sure that you are using decent switches and routers for the best performance. Also, I have seen sometimes friends have issues with network devices because they don't have enough IP addresses set aside for their internal DHCP server. Then their devices start competing for IP addresses which cause issues.",Nintendo Switch Wired Internet LAN Adapter by HORI Officially Licensed by Nintendo,0.1587962962962963,0.41111111111111104

The first didn't work but also didn't claim to and that was my mistake, not the manufacturer's. The second claimed compatibility with the Switch but did not work.. This official adapter is nearly twice the price of many others and does not offer any extra USB ports which is a fairly common feature of many cheaper adapters. However, this official adapter by Hori is truly plug and play and was recognized by the Switch instantly.

I also tested another adapter in the same port and got 161Mb/s on the speed test. I did not expect the UGREEN USB C Ethernet adapter to perform better (I used a USB c to usb a adapter to plug it into the back of the dock) as it does not officially support the Nintendo Switch.

This was after realizing that I could not play online games with my universities WIFI because it does not have a browser supported for login credentials.

0,2.0,"I bought one at Gamestop and the left joystick stopped working after a few months. I sent it back to Nintendo under warranty thinking it was a fluke and bought another one while it was being repaired. The first one came back and worked fine but then after a few more months both failed, out of warranty. The problem seems to be the ball cover of the joystick top rubs against the round opening of the case and creates all sorts of plastic dust that gets into the joystick electronic switches and causes them to fail. I opened up the case, blew out the electronics and it worked for a little bit but then the problem came back, even though I kept the joystick top clean. I tried isopropyl alcohol to flush it, vacuumed it out and it worked afterwards for a week of heavy use but then failed again. I was quoted $25 or $29 to repair. But instead I bought a third party one and it has worked longer than the other two and continues to work. Until they fix this design flaw don't throw your money away.

3,5.0,"I bought this thing because the joycons that came with my console started having issues that recalibrating was not fixing. I was so used to playing with joycons after a year of only using them. They were very comfortable as a controller in their own right, with or without the shell. I still want to get the joycons repaired or replaced someday when I get more multiplayer games/. It took me a day to acclimate to the new controller, but it already feels just as, if not more comfortable than the joycons in the joycon shell. It's heavier but not uncomfortably so, it's comfortable to grip for a few hours of gameplay. Most of the buttons have decent feedback. The battery seems to be almost as good as the joycons were, I got mine last week and still haven't had to charge it since the first day.. If I had any complaints, it's that the home menu and snapshot buttons are in an awkward location and don't have any good feedback, as they don't protrude out at all. I used to be able to take a video recording in the middle of a Splatoon game without getting pulled out of the action, but now it feels like I have to stop the action to reach the button.. EDIT: Just so you know... it turns out Pro Controllers are not immune to drift. I've got some pretty irritating drift that comes and goes.. I still say buying one of these is better than buying any more of those stupid defective joycons. You only require joycons for what, one game? A bad remake of an old pokemon game nobody asked for? The only good thing about Joycons is that you can make them into two tiny controllers but i'd honestly rather splurge to have two normal controllers.",Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.10564174564174564,0.589151164151164
4,4.0,"I used my Wii U's Pro Controller so much that there is heavy wear marks on the analog stick hats.. When I bought a Switch, I saw the price tag of this controller and thought it was ridiculous. A gamer friend chided me, telling me I'd eventually get the Pro Controller.. I got a Mayflash NS adapter and tried syncing my XBox One controller and Wii U Pro Controller to the Switch. It worked, but the controllers either suffered from large analog stick deadzones, and/or incorrect neutral point settings on the analog sticks. In frustration I shelved the adapter and just used the Switch's side controllers with the included controller bracket.. I have large hands so the Switch's side controllers were awkward to use. After about a week, I caved in and got this Pro Controller.. As the same friend said: ""Nintendo sure knows how to make a good controller"". The fit, finish, and battery life of this controller is AWESOME. I've been binge playing Payday 2 with said friend plus another friend and even during long weekend gaming sessions, my hands aren't sore or cramped thanks to this controller's ergonomics.. So is the price of this controller justifiable? In my case.... It was. But I gritted my teeth as I placed the order here on Amazon. As I've said in the past, Nintendo sure knows how to get me to open my wallet. I don't think you'll need this controller if the Switch is mostly played by children.

Works just like a normal pro controller, plus it's reddish pink. Now not only can I be more insecure about my masculinity, but all my friends who know what xenoblade is can judge me for liking such a weird-ass game. What more could you want.

7,5.0,"I figured I'd be happy with the stock Joy Con controllers in the handle. My hands are smaller than most gamers, so it was relatively comfortable for me to use them, until I tried to play Mario Kart with my brother with the individual Joy Cons... Even my smaller hands aren't tiny enough to work them comfortably, and they aren't evenly matched since the buttons are sort of off kilter as a pair.. I needed a second controller if I wanted to play properly with someone else. Enter this beauty! The Pro Controller instantly has a great feel right out of the box, with a nice sure weight that comes from its rumble pack and internal battery. It works great if you have problems using the smaller Joy Con controller in its handle accessory. The controller charges relatively quick, and pairing is easy with the console once you've plugged the charge cable into the Switch base at least once.. My only beef with it is unless you have a special case that has room for a pro controller, its a pain in the butt to transport/travel with. Anything that touches any button or joy stick will activate it and kill the battery in it. I don't plan on traveling with it much, so for a home controller, it works perfect!

I don't hate them but I don't love them either. I definitely did not want a corded controller, so the Pro A or Horipad wasn't an option (I think that is what they are called) so I just got used to the Joy con controls. My husband has really big hands so he really has a difficult time playing with the Joy Cons. He doesn't play the Switch that often so it wasn't a big deal. I didn't realize the Pro Controller had come out until recently but I didn't really want to spend the money at the time.. However, I just saw that it was on sale after I bought ""Let's go Eevee"" so I hit the buy it now button and I am really glad I did!!!!. The controller is set just like a pair of Joy Cons so no trying to remember a new pattern. It fits very comfortable in my hands and my husband's hands. Similar in design as the Xbox and PlayStation controls (see photos for comparison) It has a more rounded feel opposed to the Joy Cons. It feels durable and the battery lasts...I played for two days, all day, while my foot was in a cast and it didn't die on me.. So far I have played with it on BOTW, Mario Cart 8 and Fortnite. It is not compatible with Let's go Eevee, but there is the Pokeball plus for that.

2,5.0,"I have been a Nintendo Switch owner for almost a year, and while I love the joy-con controller and grip overall, sometimes I prefer a more reliable and ""traditional"" controller. I finally picked this controller up on amazon this week. I love it. This is one of the most comfortable controllers I have ever used, which increases the enjoyment of my Switch games even more. The battery life is good, the layout makes sense, and it has built in motion-sensors for gyro-scope aiming, which comes in handy for games like ""Splatoon 2"" and ""Zelda: Breath of the Wild."" The only major downside to this controller is that the button layout for the ""pause"" and ""home"" buttons took a while to get used to, partially since the color scheme can make the buttons look similar. Other than that, I have no real issues with this controller; the battery life is good, and the controller itself is very comfortable, maybe matching the Gamecube controller as my favorite Nintendo controller. I would recommend picking this controller up for your switch. I spent months playing hours of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but worried about the stability of the controller I was using to some extent. Now I can comfortably sit back and play Breath of the Wild for even more hours on end with a controller that feels great! The controller is a little pricey, but more than worth it.

3,1.0,"This controller is fantastic at first, but is destined to have problems. Know that if you buy a Pro Controller, chances are, you WILL have problems down the line. It's such a bummer that this is a common issue among Switch owners. I take great care of my things, and my Pro controller has 2 significant problems after about 6 months of use.. 1) Left stick issues. When pushing the left stick upwards, the controller experiences what I've been calling ""reverse drift"" -- it pulls the input down. I've calibrated dozens of times, and this fixes the issue momentarily, but it always comes back.. 2) R-button issues. The R button's input works OK, but only if you push the button down with a bit more force. If you're playing a game that requires holding down the R button (like checking the map on Hollow Knight for example), the button will lose input unless you're really pushing down.. This is my 3rd Switch controller to give me issues. I have 2 sets of Joycons that experience joystick problems as well. I love my Switch and am super bummed by their controller issues.. It's worth noting that this controller is pretty expensive for the issues it experiences. I've had multiple DualShock 4s for years, with much more playtime on them, with no issues. Same with Gamecube controllers -- some of which I've had since the early 2000s. This is simply unacceptable for a company of Nintendo's stature and a controller of this price. Please Nintendo.

This is pretty unacceptable for the cost of this controller. Add the fact that it hasn't gotten nearly as much use as the joy-cons as I mostly play in handheld mode. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of the build.. If these things can't even last a year of moderate use, then you're better off buying a cheaper third-party controller.

This means there will be no smooth throttle or braking in any future racing games unless you were to make use of the right stick for that purpose.. It's worth noting that the overall build and feel of the controller lacks some of the soft touch plastics and rubbers of many modern controllers, Xbox One controllers usually have a pretty soft touch plastic at the grips, and you can custom order one with rubberized grips, the back of the Pro controller looks like it would have rubberized grips, but it is in fact the hardest plastic I've ever held with a controller.",Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.1285714285714286,0.36092436974789915
8,4.0,"Where to begin.... I've always been fine with the Joycons, Handheld mode, in the grip, or one in each hand. I don't mind any of those control methods, nor do I find their D-Pad buttons to be a problem. But I bought this controller for Smash Ultimate and to see what all the fuss was about, because I don't want my Joycons breaking in a moment of carelessness.. I thought the Joycons were solid enough for the most part, but this thing, you could practically crack chestnuts with it. From the minute I opened the box and took it in hand, I thought ""this isn't the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but this thing is sturdy!"". I charged it up right out of the box, played a bit with the wired connection (haven't had any lag problems at all in Wizard of Legend with it) and it finished charging from the Switch dock in a couple hours. Over the next month, I played with it every day when my Switch was docked (I just stopped taking hte Joycons off the main unit when docking it since getting this). It took, with about an hour or more of play per day, maybe a month before I got a ""low battery"" warning from this controller.. Analog sticks are definitely taller, and face buttons are definitely bigger than the Joycons. That felt a bit odd at first, but I can switch between this and the Joycons/handheld mode for any game I own without trouble. The only difference I had to get used to is the placement of the + and - buttons; rather than being above each thumb as on the Joycons, they're between my hand here.. I've had no troubles with the D-Pad, and find I rather enjoy it. Got this thing back in April, and have had no troubles at all with either analog stick or the D-Pad. (Which registers up, down, left, right, or diagonals only if I press them- no false positives at all from my Pro Controller.). Reads Amiibo just fine, I place them in the center of the controller to scan them in after I remember the right thumbstick does nothing .. This is an entirely optional purchase for me, especially as I've always been more of a handheld gaming man, and am perfectly fine with the Switch's provided controller setup. But the Pro Controller is the best-feeling thing I've held that I can recall, as far as gaming goes. (Note: I've owned Game Boys, DSes, the Gamecube and Wii, and the Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2 for my PC, and that's basically it besides the 8bitdo NES30 Pro.). I have no fears of anything ever breaking this Nintendium-forged artifact, and it still looks as new as it did out of the package down to minute details. Also, the battery is massively overkill- I love it.. If you think you'd like one of these, and are okay with whatever the asking price is at the moment, go right ahead. You can use it with Windows and Android phones or tablets as well, so if this controller lasts as long as my old Logitech has, $70 should average out to maybe pennies per month, especially since it works with a bunch of different machines.

The buttons are clicky and the directional pad is much better than using the joycons. The battery life is amazing and it charges quickly through USB-C.. If this worked cross platform fluidly, this would be my go to controller for all video games. It's very similar to the Xbox One controller, but the grips are a little bit thinner and I'm just able to get a more solid grip than the Xbox One controller.. After months of use, it still works and feels like new. The construction is solid and there's no flex in the plastic when you grip it tight during intense moments. I've gone through probably 3 Xbox one controllers because the plastic starts to squeak after a few months of use and the buttons become unresponsive. So Kudos to Nintendo for continuing to make quality controllers.. The NFC tag works nicely for scanning amiibos if that's your thing.. One warning, and this may have been fixed with a controller update, but after not using one of the controllers for a few months, the battery drained and would only worked while plugged in. Even with charging for a few hours, it wouldn't charge. I decided to just leave it charging for a few days (using the provided Nintendo USB C to A charger plugged into the switch) and it worked again.

The buttons are nice and big and feel great to press, the weight is good, the sticks feel great, like all Nintendo analog sticks do. HD rumble and motion controls work fine and battery life is worlds ahead of the PS4 controller. The D-pad is a step down from typically Nintendo design though, having no ball underneath the center, so every direction can be pushed in at once, which can occasionally cause problems, but I've played a ton of Tetris and shovel Knight with it and it's still pretty solid. The erganomics are stellar though, to be sure. Feels better than any other controller that I can think of and I think the Xbox one S controller is pretty top notch comfort-wise. Also, with the right Bluetooth controller adapter it can be used on the PS3 and aside from the six axis crap not being present it works perfectly.

This is devastating in Zelda BotW. Yea, I‚Äôve recalibrated, blah blah. Several times. Turns out this is a regular defect. Just google it. For $60, that‚Äôs shameful.

9,4.0,"UPDATE MAY 2020: Not that bad. So after I wrote my initial review, I was able to get the stripped screw off (and destroyed the grip in the process, having to order replacements from ebay). Then over the ensuing months I tore apart the controller probably 20 times, trying different variations of the tape trick to fix the D-pad with varied success. The tape did largely correct the false inputs, but at the cost of sometimes not registering button presses. In the end, I decided to take off all the tape and use it as it was originally designed to be used, and guess what? It isn't all that bad. Sure, when you do the input test in Switch settings it registers LOTS of false inputs, but this is less noticeable during actual game play. Now granted, I'm not a professional gamer, but I used the D-pad extensively to play Rayman Legends and Super Mario Maker, and it worked just fine. So in conclusion, yes, the D-pad is far from perfect, it's a major blemish in an otherwise perfect controller and a disgrace for Nintendo, but NO, it is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It's probably still the best Switch controller out there at the time of writing. My advice is to buy it and spend some time actually using it before buying into all the negative hype and trying to mess with it. It really isn't all that bad. (with regards to my original review, everything I had said about the design and ergonomics still holds true, even with the aftermarket replacement grips I had to install).. ------. Original review:. First off, this controller looks and feels amazing. It's probably the most ergonomic controller I've ever held, and *almost* everything about it feels extremely well-built. But I say ""almost,"" because there's one major inexcusable flaw that just ruins it for me, and that's the D-pad. If you do a quick search, you'll see that this has been an issue with Pro Controllers since the very first model. The D-pad is way too squishy, and registers incorrect inputs when you move between directions quickly. It just blows my mind, how Nintendo, the company that INVENTED the D-pad can get away with making such a poorly designed sub-par one and putting it inside their Pro controller. There IS a fix, but it requires opening the controller and putting tape on the chip. I attempted it, but ended up stripping one of the screws and now it'll be impossible to ever open it up. So I'm stuck with a $70 ""premium"" controller with a D-pad that's so imprecise that it's borderline unusable. If playing games with a D-pad is at all important to you, save yourself the headache and frustration and buy a PS4 controller and an 8bitdo or Mayflash receiver. I used to always prefer official accessories going all the way back to the NES, but sadly, this whole experience has made me lose faith in Nintendo.",Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.07291059280855201,0.5309685779073534
0,5.0,Update 8/31/20: Upgrading back to 5/5 stars! Turns out I accidentally turned motion control on without knowing it. Once I found that and turned it off the issue was gone.. Please ignore my negative comment below.. I bought this controller in January 2020 and up until the last week or so (August 2020) it was working great and I absolutely loved it. I was totally fine with paying what I did and would‚Äôve happily done so again.. Unfortunately around last week my controller started having an issue where the left analog stick was drifting the the left and nothing could fix it. I tried recalibrating the stick in the Nintendo Switch settings and it would fix it for about 30 seconds before it started drifting again.. This issue is particularly noticeable in games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe where my racer will start drifting to the left which makes racing almost impossible since I can‚Äôt control my own car drifting while racing.. Sadly my warranty expired and I‚Äôm really annoyed that I paid so much only for it to break in less than a year. I take good care of it and always wash my hands before playing so it‚Äôs not an issue of poor treatment of the controller.. I hope other people don‚Äôt have this issue but felt I should mention it since it happened to me.,Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.07500000000000002,0.5329710144927536
1,5.0,"With 20,957 reviews and climbing fast, will you ever see mine? I specialize in tech reviews and even if not, here‚Äôs the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù scoop. We compared the $70 Nintendo version to two of the highest rated generic ones, the excellent Funlab and the YCCTEAM. I will include links to those reviews below:. In short, for RUMBLE effects, the Nintendo is more subtle and responsive-- the others work fine but the rumble is a bit overdone. Otherwise, the generic controllers are both terrific. Nintendo wins the battery life battle but in practical terms this is a non-issue. Who wants to be playing for 30 hours straight?. (Full disclosure: 30 hours of straight gaming without recharging. Who‚Äôd want that?? We do! But we never would!). Here are those reviews that I hope may be of help in your decision:. In closing, which is our favorite of the three? The Nintendo, if affordable.

2,3.0,"So I've had this Pro controller for a month now and felt I'd been hands on long enough for a full review. Gotten about 150hours on Monster Hunter Generations and played a little Breath of the Wilds,. I'm coming from 30+ years of gaming experience and have used every leading console developers (Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, Sony) 1st party controllers since NIntendo Entertainment System onwards to today. I've owned many, but have used all of them extensively at some point. I've been on PS4 extensively since lunch, easily putting 2k+ hours a year, and 3k hours on Monster Hunter World since launch. So PS4 controller is my most relevant comparison now so you know were im coming from.. So firstly, I consider the Pro Controller to be a big improvement over the standard Switch Joy Cons. The Joy Cons ar3 just way to small, right Anolog stick in particular hurts my average sized hands after 30min of use, and button spacing isn't great. To be fare, there Controllers ment for a handheld and in that space they do there job reasonably well. So if you want a more traditional Controller for couch gameing, it's the Pro or a GameCube controller clone, and the Pro is probably a better choice assuming you need motion controls.. The Switch Pro controller isn't terrible for sure. Size is fine, maybe slightly small, but decent for average man hands and probably great for smaller hands. But immediately I noticed the Anolog Sticks aren't great. The press function is too tight, Anolog placement feels off and need to be about 25% bigger. I've heard ALOT of stick drift issues, but a month isn't long enough for that to be a issue. Face buttons fell a little mushy, no click or feed back at all. And the face buttons are raised far too much, makeing simultaneously pressing two buttons inaccurate. The ZR/ZL triggers aren't variable at all, this could be particularly frustrating on a racing game, as it's either full or no throttle. I don't mind them not being variable since I play RPGs mostly, and they feel responsive. However the L/R shoulder buttons are awful! They drop inputs frequently and sometimes don't register promptly. Unfortunately many games use shoulder inputs frequently, Monster Hunter GU being a strong example of were this is a issue. It seems to be because the actual button press happens on the outer edges, meaning to get a responsive touch you need to hold them with fingers in claw like hold. This causes alot of finger fatigue on medium sized hands and surely far worse on large hands. 4 way D-Pad is fine, and probably better than PS4 controllers.. I've also noticed the left grip moves slightly already, the grips are separate pieces and shift slightly. They don't feel like there breaking, but it's unnerving to have this in 30days. Finally my biggest gripe is there is absolutely no 3.5mm standard headset inputs on the controller, and I've been told USB-C inputs don't work either. So you still need to use the Switch 3.5mm input for a headset. This is 16years behind other console devs, and is completely unexeptable in the age of online gaming.. 3 stars I'd is very fare, it's not terrible and unfortunately is probably your only choice for a traditional Switch controller. But aside fantastic battery life and decent ergonomics, it well below what I've come to expect from Sony and Microsoft since lunch of Xbox360 in 2005.",Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.11025132275132271,0.5254243827160493
3,4.0,"...the Directional Pad is *very* subpar. If you're only going to use it for accessing features or items like in Super Mario Odyssey or Breath of the Wild, it works just fine. However if you're going to use it for retro or 2D games it leaves much to be desired. There's no central pivot point like in most every good D-Pad allowing you to hit Up, Down, Left, and Right at the same time and they are sensitive so you will be hitting directions you don't mean to. There's ways to modify it and there's tutorials all over YouTube, but you will have to disassemble the whole thing to do it. I have yet to do it but people have said it makes it a lot better.. That said everything about this controller is fantastic. It's not a nice weight, feels quality. It is by far the most comfortable controller I've ever held. It lasts seemingly forever. It says 40 hours but I've yet to put a dent in the battery icon even after extended play. Motion controls are flawless and precise. If it wasn't for the D-Pad I'd say this is the best controller ever made. I don't know why Nintendo dropped the ball on that considering they are the ones who perfected them.. If you're looking for something for classic or 2D games line the Online NES games, Sonic Mania, or Mario Maker this might not be fore you but all of your 3D titles couldn't be played on a better controller. If you want something for 2D games, there's some for sale here on Amazon that look like SNES controllers but with analog sticks (ones without sticks are also available) with an amazing D-Pad. Not sure if I'm allowed to mention them by name in reviews but they're not hard to find if you search for Nintendo Switch controlers.. Update:. After using this on Super Mario Maker 2 the D Pad works a lot better out of the box than I expected. Though not perfect it's fine for casual play but I'm sure people who do kizo levels might find problems. I've been using this with few problems. Occasional accidental diagonal presses but not nearly as frequent as what I saw when first trying out some of NES games. Might need it to be broken in a little. Still prefer the D Pad on the other controller but this one is so much more comfortable in my hands.",Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.1908012495778454,0.5490754812563324
4,3.0,"This controller was perfect in the beginning. After spending $70 a pop on 3 joy cons, we gave this a shot. Granted, if it were just adults playing with it, it would probably last longer. But for an excited 9 year old who gets pretty intense while playing, the left knob starts it's ""sway thing"" just like all the others. I have bought and still own every Nintendo console ever made and I have never had any issues with the old contollers. This is too expensive to have to buy these every few months like the crap xbox controllers we use on a PC.

Right out of the box, my Animal Crossing character moves without me touching the controller. And the camera moves too..

6,2.0,"Unfortunately the left joystick started drifting down after about 6 months. I'm not a pro smash player or anything, so it seems hard to fathom that I used it more intensely than most during that time. I also kept it really clean, regularly wiping off the residue that easily accumulates on this controller while in use with a soft, dry towel.. The other sad part is that Nintendo isn't taking de-facto responsibility for this issue. After I contacted them, they informed me that Pro Controllers purchased outside of the console are only under warranty for 3 months. After I insisted that I would not pay any amount of money for a controller they call ""Pro"" that malfunctioned in 6 months and pointing out the similarities with the class-action joy-con suit, the rep put me on hold to see what he could do. After he returned, he offered me a ""one-time"" free repair.. Considering the potential repair costs, if the controller were to malfunction ($30 is 1/2 the cost of a new controller, not to mention however much shipping would have cost), it's hard for me to recommend this product. The main reason I left this at 2 stars is because I had to be quite forceful when talking to the Nintendo rep on the phone which made the whole experience very sour. Had Nintendo taken responsibility more readily for an already known issue (assuming that whatever is plaguing joy-con is also plaguing my Pro Controller - which I could see given how many fewer Pro Controllers there must be in the wild compared to joy-con) I would have likely given this 3 stars, if not 4.",Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.07924915824915826,0.5191785806785807

9,4.0,"It's one of the most ergonomically comfortable video game controllers I've ever used. I have arthritis and cannot play on most controllers very long at all & this controller was a huge change for me, because now I can actually play video games for more than 20 minutes at a time again without pain. I like that you can also use it on PC for Steam games. I had some issues with mine where the plastic hand grips did not line up flush with the controller body and I had to return a few and do a Nintendo repair to finally get one that didn't have that issue, but that wasn't a serious issue and I think it's just that I really hate the feel of a noticeable edge on my hands. The controller does have an issue with the D pad sometimes registering the wrong inputs. I never noticed this problem until Tetris 99.

The left toggle switch gets glitchy after two plus months or more depending on level of play, and it seems to be common from what I've read. None of the fixes worked for me. For $70 I expect it to last longer even under a lot of play time. Most reviews fault the left toggle.. I bought it after I bought my Switch expressly to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I found the JoyCons awkward for this game. It is a fabulous, sumptuous and gorgeously realized game. However since this started, it has gotten to be more consistent in it's glitch to the 180 position. Link trots along or runs away from monsters, and as soon as I stop him, he does an immediate about face and starts walking off!!! I can't have him walking blithely to his death every time he stops in a dangerous place. I have to keep pushing the toggle back to get him to finally stand still, and it's become ridiculous, so I'm forced to order another if I want to finish the game! He's walked off cliffs, stood up from a crouch to walk away and been peppered with arrows, scared away game, and drawn the attention of enemies all because this left toggle is suddenly massively glitchy. I tried canned air to blow out any dust, but it seems like a part failure. He almost walked of a Divine Beast in the middle of the air!.

You could still see that the image was lifted off the box from the first time it was opened. The controller inside has a piece rattling around.. The D-pad does whatever it wants. This is most evident when playing SNES or NES games, where the joystick usually puts you at a disadvantage. Every press of the D-pad left or right has a 20% chance of reading as a diagonal..

It feels like a flaw in the design, where it overshoots from snapback. If you press the thumbstick all the way one direction and then let go, (which happens naturally when I play), it snaps back into position, then overshoots and changes direction.

This is technically compatible with PC but you will have to use it wirelessly, and due to some odd bug the gyro glitches out the DirectInput controls if you have this enabled in Steam... so you have to manually choose between DirectInput OR steam, can't do both at the same time, with that said you'll still want to have an XBOX controller on hand for the occasional PC game where you find yourself wanting a controller.

4,4.0,"I mainly use this for PC gaming but obviously it pairs well with the Switch. Which imo you may as well buy this asap after getting a Switch because the joycons are the worst input devices I've ever used in my 40 years on Earth. The Golden Tee trackball during 25 cent chicken wing night at the local bowling alley 20 years ago is more reliable and accurate than joycons. But I'm getting off topic.. The grip is comfortable. I prefer the way the analog/dpad is setup compared to Playstation controllers. Unlike most Xbox controllers it comes with a charging cord instead of hoping you buy AA batteries in 20XX. Buttons are nice and responsive, the right trigger has taken a pounding since I've bought it and seems to be holding up just fine. Rumble feels fantastic on both Switch and PC. This is obviously the way to go if you need a Switch controller and don't want to mess with adapters or 3rd party pad.. So what's the issue? Why the 4 star review instead of 5?. Simple. There's slop in the dpad. I can't think of any reason why when I hold left or right on the dpad it wants to also toggle between up and down randomly. If you're considering this controller and you play games that require very precise dpad inputs like fighting games or kaizo Mario then I suggest looking elsewhere.. When something is called ""pro"" there's a weight to that word. It has connotations of being precise and well built to a standard that would be acceptable to professionals. I'm not a pro gamer by any means at all, I'm not even good enough to be called an amateur. But I believe anyone who plays any kind of game only wants to experience failure due to their own actions.

I say that since this is built like a normal console controller. Very similar to the Xbox. The controller is larger then the joycons and the placement of buttons is awkward at first and took some time getting used to it. It feels great though and overtime it‚Äôs become my preferred controller. I wish however that it wasn‚Äôt so noisy. Every top face button pressed makes a loud sound.

USB-C support and HD rumble are some pretty nice features. The textured grip and textured buttons are pretty satisfying. My problems with the controller have to be about 2 things. #1, the price is incredibly jacked up, I admit it's a good controller, but 70 dollars is way too much, even more than an entire switch game. 2#, the A feels way too of to the side when playing, as well as it feels like it's jammed sometimes.",Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,0.20916666666666667,0.5778030303030303
8,5.0,"So we just got these the other day, so this isn't a review on their longevity. However, we absolutely love these controllers in comparison to the joy cons. These are SOOO much better.. We've been playing Age of Calamity in 2 player mode, and it was a huge pain and no fun to do with the Joy cons. These controllers are worlds better. They are a little big compared to a PS4 controller, but a better shape than the combined joycons.. They have a nice heft to them, and they're rechargeable. A lot of the 3rd party controllers for the Switch weren't rechargeable, and most, if not all, were not compatible with amiibos. If amiibos matter to you, it might be worth noting that the PowerA controllers and other 3rd party controllers probably aren't compatible.. As for their charge, we charged them straight out of the box, played with them about every night for the past week and they still have a charge to them. I can't really quantify that in hours, but they definitely seem to last longer than our PS4 controllers (which are a couple years older to be fair).. Last point of note is the button mapping. Trying to play Age of Calamity with 1 joycon per person, the buttons on each controller is limited, and the button mapping was confusing and aggravating. Having a controller or complete set of Joycons per person is really the best way to play, and it's definitely less aggravating. I'm not the best gamer, so when the button layout became too confusing with the joycons, I just ignored the confusing buttons (which in this particular game included the button to heal yourself).. Last points of note is that they do come with their own charging cords, which plug right into the side of the Switch docking station for easy charging. They are a Type C cord, so most phone charges would probably work as well.

0,5.0,"I absolutely love this game. I have never played anything like this, no XCOM style games, no games at all really except for just really easy stuff, games that don't require much thought, like Mario Kart. I didn't think I would like this one, but I gave it a try. I'm 37 years old if that makes a difference, but I would say that this is a family-friendly game. There is some potty-humor, some flatulence and sometimes Beep-O (the leader that looks like a robotic vacuum) has an attitude and he may swear but the swear words are in this form - #%&$! - and it only happens 2, maybe 3 times. I think that would just fly over a young child's head. There isn't any blood or gore and it's not incredibly violent - sure, you're ""shooting"" and blowing up characters, but it's tasteful - they just sort of disappear instead of piling up around you. Some of the puzzles are surprisingly difficult, or maybe I'm just not nearly as smart as I thought I was. I had more trouble figuring a few of those out than I would like to admit, lol.. I was frustrated at first, even though looking back the game starts off incredibly easy. I just had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. It definitely gives you a chance to learn the ropes, so if you are like me and have never played this style game, you CAN easily pick it up. It does get increasingly difficult, and pretty quickly. If you are skilled at these types of games, I wouldn't worry about it being too easy altogether. Once I got the hang of it I could not put it down. I just beat the final boss last night and I was thrilled to find that there was more to the game after that - you can go back and do more things and find hidden ""Ultimate Challenges"".. The animation is fantastic. The scenery is beautiful, the characters are adorable, the bosses are really cool. Rabbid Peach is my favorite - she's a social media obsessed diva. She's always stopping to take selfies of herself with her cell phone and when the team loses a match or challenge she yanks off her wig and crown (off camera) and throws them towards the other 2 team members. It's just really cute, I found myself laughing out loud a lot during gameplay. The soundtrack is marvelous.. I have come across a couple of glitches in the game - the ""A"" button sometimes stops working and I can't do anything - I can bring up the menu with the ""+"" button but it's just scrolling through really quickly, I can't select any of the options. All I can do is close the software and start again at the last saved point. During the last few chapters of the game I had some trouble with the software closing on its own - an error message that said something like this software has encountered an error and needs to close. Hopefully, those things are fixed with future updates or patches, if that's possible.. I am very happy that I went outside of my comfort zone and gave this game a try. I hope there are more like it in the future. I give it a 10 out of 10. :-)",Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.12317432760141088,0.5348930776014109
1,2.0,"Very disappointed in the seller. Immediately after opening my package I noticed the games box was damaged. The cover was completely sliced in half. This wouldn't have been an issue if I knew before hand that I was getting a damaged box item, but it was advertised as NEW by the seller. The item had been taped back together in plastic with a sticker and barcode that said the item was new as well. I still decided to try the game out to see if it worked, and I had brought the package out of town with me so I had nothing else to do. Luckily it did work.

2,4.0,"(M.K.Lake's Son): I am a HUGE tactical game fan.. I started with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and have been in-love with them since.. This is a very very interesting game, its a lil short but I would rather Quality over Quantity.. There isn't a huge plot there is no huge drama like most..Its honestly the plot of a Mario game you'd expect.. Go here do this etc etc.. But the simplicity is honestly a great change (For tactics games) and one of the beautify that is the Mario series..While this wasn't developed by Nintendo internally..It's got the silliness and goofiness that makes it fun for all ages. The combat is modified from Xcom1/2's award winning formula that is pretty deep, but its also slimmed down so younger audiences can enjoy which makes it feel a tad shallower but nothing I would want to complain about.. I'm just putting everything out there so people can enjoy..The only serious gripe I have..again I said it earlier I prefer quality over quantity is the games length.. BUT I will honestly be replaying it again. It's worth every penny....I will be looking forward to Mario+Rabbits 2...OH! ONE.LAST.THING! Rabbids..I have not really been overly fond of them, but I rather like the ones that you get on your team and some of the zany antics they do during the game. When this game was announced I rolled my eyes bit its lent its self well to the great games for the switches first-year...So honestly its pretty darn awesome. :)",Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.18218315972222224,0.6173611111111111
3,5.0,"This game came far out of left field. Mario and crew with guns? In a tactical rpg a la x-com or jagged alliance? What were the designers smoking when they thought of this? Nevertheless, it's executed flawlessly. No RNG frustrations, no save scumming necessary. Lots of little nods to various Mario lore and history. Challenging scenarios, solid skill progression where I never felt over nor under-powered, and great artwork. The plot is horribly contrived but who cares. My 3 year old was riveted with every battle and she'd be the one composing the team. Lastly, Rabbids came before Minions and it's a crime that Minions have become so popular.",Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.03660714285714285,0.5833333333333333
4,5.0,"I love the thought and planning that goes into playing this game!. My son says it's like a strategy board game.. I read lots of reviews that made me think it would be fun, but the negative reviews worried me. I resorted to watching online videos of gameplay and game reviews. I'm glad I got this, it's one of my favorites. My 9 y.o. Son doesnt choose to play this(he isn't patient at all though) but he loves to give his input while watching me! But my friend's 9 y.o. loves it , and we compare notes.. Its Turn based battle, my 3 characters get turns to move, and attack inflicting damage on the bad guy rabbids, shrinking their health bars. Then they get turns to do the same to my team. Mario Peach and Luigi (and their mishmashed rabbid counterparts) have weapons and acrobatic skills. You. Plan out your steps of attack on the bad guy rabbids (they're oddly cute, especially the zebra/mohawk looking ones) and then watch your character execute what can be multiple steps/ actions, to clear the level/area/challenge.. Some levels are easy, but you can bet they get more challenging! They prepare you bit by bit, adding skills and tips along the way.. You collect power orbs to improve you characters abilities, and coins to buy new and improved weaponry!. This game is so satisfying... I get invested in battles because I am striving for perfection and efficiency, the planning and brainstorming lend themselves to that accomplishment when you prevail over a challenging situation.",Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.06446608946608948,0.591883116883117
5,5.0,"For those of you that like the Fire Emblem series, I recommend giving this game a shot. It‚Äôs good, plan and simple. Now for those of you that are skeptical, I‚Äôll do my best to try and convince you to join the cause to save the Mushroom Kingdom.. Now as a veteran gamer the first thing that would turn me off to this game are the Rabbids themselves. I‚Äôm here to tell you not to worry. They are nowhere near as annoying as they were in the old Rayman raving rabid games. In fact they are actually funny from time to time. It‚Äôs still slapstick humor, so don‚Äôt expect high brow jokes. As soon as you reach the first gameplay section, it‚Äôs apparent that the graphics are nothing short of stunning, especially the levels themselves. They are filled with such detail and personality, my favorite being the vines that play the music in the spooky kingdom. And in the battles themselves the animation work is also top notch, although there are a few caveats I need to mention, the most troublesome in my opinion is the camera, you don‚Äôt have control over it as much as I‚Äôd like. It can only be moved in 90 degree angles I‚Äôve lost a gun fight or two because I couldn‚Äôt get a good view of the battle field. Now In a close second, is a gameplay mechanic. Those of you that are Fire Emblem vets will share my pain. In FE you get into a habit of moving your characters close to the enemies in order to see how much damage you will inflict on your foes, If it‚Äôs not to your liking you will simply tap B and warp back to where you were correct? Well in this game once you move your character and press A your locked in, so it‚Äôs a little tough fighting an urge that was second nature in FE. Other then that every character( a total of about 8) has a special ability and a specific role to play in your team(e.g sniper, healer etc.) Mario however is a permanent fixture so I recommend buying better gear for him as soon as it‚Äôs available to you. The game also won‚Äôt hold your hand so be prepared to be in for a tough time if you get careless. There is also a Co-op mode but I recommend playing it with a friend once you‚Äôve beaten the game, as that will unlock all the levels. Oh and stay away from any Hard challenges that you get by clearing a map in story mode, unless of course you like fighting the urge not to stab your Switch in the face repeatedly. The bottom line is I can‚Äôt wait for a sequel, Ubisoft really set a standard for 3rd party development on this one.

6,4.0,"To begin with this game maybe a hit or miss depending on who's playing it. This game is surprisingly fun and easy to get into, yes it is simpler version of other strategy games. If you have played xcom before then you will be pretty familiar with how this game runs, but in a much simpler pace. The game is not trying to become something that it's not, it's not as serious as xcom when it comes to mechanics, upgrades and stuff. It's still a fun game to get into, explore the world and its colors. Check it out if you have a switch and if you like this kinds of game or you could wait for a sale if you don't feel like spending $60.00 on a game like this.

The music was outstanding and easy to listen into. Finally, it was so difficult to complete but paid off in the end..

8,4.0,"Fun turned based game that is probably a different experience for a lot of Nintendo fans. Unbisoft was allowed to use Nintendo characters and trademarks. They essentially took a Mario looking environment and married that to a turned based strategy game similar to Xcom. The game has more depth than what first appears.. The only thing is this is Mario, Lugi and all the rest of the gang are here but they look slightly off. This is because this is actually not a first party Nintendo title. While it is exclusive to the Switch and it has Nintendo characters it is Ubisoft who made this game. So it looks like Ubisoft porting Mario into theirgame engine. Not really a knock or anything, and it look great, it's just kind of strange to see Mario who looks slight off from his usual self. More of a curiosity than a complaint really.

9,4.0,Great game with a fair amount of replay ability. It is a game rather unique to itself where I am rather sure it is the first with this hit and run mechanics. I really love that this game gives you both the feeling of it being more fun than strategy yet at the same time if you forget the strategy part you will loose badly! It starts off with a easy enough pace that you can get the feel and really start to learn the mechanics and ramps it up slowly throughout the game to get to some really complicated maneuvers where you really have to think on some of these later levels.

When he got it he was super excited because apparently he‚Äôs been wanting this game for a while.. When he started playing, I watched him a little and he picked up the game easily. The controls are simply and easy to learn. The gameplay itself and battles are a little different style compared to some other mario games, but he loves it (as do I, it reminds immensely of final fantasy). The graphics are nice and the puzzles within the storyline (outside of the battles) are challenging. The weapons are well thought out and match each character. The game itself is also pretty long and will last a while, which is good because my little brother finishes games SUPER quickly.

1,5.0,"I honestly did not expect much out of it, but it surprised me. It was fun, engaging and even though I usually find the rabbids pretty annoying, the type of humor was varied enough that I got quite a few good laughs. There is a little multiplayer, though my younger siblings found it more fun to make suggestions of moves to make (it is turn based, similar to chess in a way) and to watch and laugh at the cutscenes and animations. If you get this, I would recommend also getting the Donkey Kong DLC, as it adds on not only more levels but new gameplay which I found quite refreshing. The only downside is the last few levels got pretty repetative and boring. I actually stopped about 4 levels away from completion to play (and finish) the DK DLC before going back and finishing the game.

The thought of turn-based battle piqued my interest but thought that it would be too goofy and silly to execute with Mario; especially Rabbids.. Oh boy, was I totally wrong! I love Frozen Synapse and X-COM, and this game was something completely different; not in a bad way too! Having characters assist jump to ambush enemies, Vampire Dash to sap for health, sentries, rocket launchers, hammers, oh my!

3,5.0,"What can I say. I haven‚Äôt been too impressed with Ubisoft. As much as people like Rayman, I‚Äôve always thought its platforming uninspiring and boring. Assassins Creed has been sequeled to death and has become a bland experience.. Enter Mario + Rabbids. Yes, this game is developed and published by Ubisoft, but this game is oozing Nintendo‚Äôs magic.. The gameplay is addictive. I‚Äôve never played Xcom but have been told it‚Äôs a simpler, more fun version. Take that for what it‚Äôs worth. I play M+R and keep having to the play next level. I have to keep trying to get more coins, better weapons, more power orbs. And obtaining these items aren‚Äôt a chore like they are in so many other games. It‚Äôs acually fun.. The feel of the game is charming. I love Rabbid Peach so much. I am not the most jovial person, but I have laughed so much because of her sass. All of the characters, including the enemies and bosses, have all sorts of quirks. The baddies seem to tough when they‚Äôre attacking your team. But when you get one at the end of your colorful barrel, they cower in fear. Everything in this game is cute. And it even features a humorous musical number during a boss fight (which reminded me of a similar boss fight song in Conkers Bad Fur Day.). There are so many goodies to collect which strengthens the replay value. Instead of moving on to the next world, I have have to go back and complete all the new challenges in the old worlds and find anything I may have missed.. Get this game. It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs cute.

The game marries the whackiness of its concept with surprisingly tight combat maps that can be navigated with a unique combination of character mobility and team boosts, with the kind of random elements that can turn even a solid strategy askew and keep you on your toes for battle after battle.

6,4.0,A very good strategy with all the polish you would come to expect from Nintendo (I know Ubisoft made the game but there is a reason Nintendo allowed them to use Mario characters). The game starts off easy enough and gets more challenge as you progress. The game is appropriate for kids but young children may get frustrated with it as some of the end game fights can be challenging. Spent roughly 35-40hrs playing through the game..

7,4.0,"Nobody would think that a crossover between Mario and the Rabbids would be a good idea. Somebody did, and it turns out that it was a great idea. The gameplay itself is a bizarre mutation of the XCOM formula, but was given a Super Mario twist, wherein characters are able to perform platforming-style jumps, execute moves using certain field items, and dodge hazards from Mario's classic enemies. All the while fighting the Rabbid menace.. There are a few shortcomings, such as not being able to undo certain moves on the game field (like moving to a spot that you didn't mean to), and certain skill trees seeming to be slightly underpowered.

Lastly, the difficulty of the game felt a bit too easy, it was only during the last world that the flight began to ramp up in difficulty and forced strategic thinking.",Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.05217391304347827,0.41478260869565214
4,5.0,I love this game! It does get VERY difficult in the later worlds. It is a gradual increase in difficulty. It does a great job of introducing new techniques and items to broaden your options to execute battles. It is funny and gorgeous to look at whether docked in tv mode OR in handheld. I originally assumed this title would be lackluster and boring. I could not have been more wrong. Pick this one up if you are a turn based RPG fan (which ironically i am not) or if u just enjoy a relaxing strategy game that offers great visuals and laughs along the way.,Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.09446022727272727,0.619034090909091
5,5.0,"This game is a big departure from the usual Super Mario Bros spinoffs. The game is very much like X-COM with the turn based strategy with an emphasis on shooting, positioning, and cover based mechanics. The game however also is unique in its own way with Mario inspired unique abilities such as dash attacks, jumps, and team work abilities to damage enemies as well as navigate the environment easier and faster. The game also has relatively easy puzzles to solve while traversing the map, sometimes to collect collectibles, while other times to proceed to the next level.",Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.02677777777777777,0.5056666666666667
6,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant game, been playing it for over a month now, and have to get on the DK extension. Having a Rabbids and Mario combo game seemed weird, but after reading review, i had to give it ago. The game involve a lot of strategy, especially to achieve a perfect score and completing the challenges.. The fact that you can redo the battles after finishing each worlds adds a lot of replayability. And it gives you the chance to rethink your strategy and finish the battle in as little turns as possible..

8,4.0,"The silly little DLC's, such as the ""pixel pack"" that came with the game since I pre-ordered it, are kind've dumb and pointless. I honestly didn't even know that would come with my copy of the game, but I couldn't really care less that it did, and it didn't do anything to enhance the gameplay experience.. The amount of missions and activities that come with the game, without the purchase of DLC, are more than adequate, which is a relief. I was glad Ubisoft didn't gate off core features of the game and hold them for ransom. You're actually getting a full gameplay experience with the purchase of this title alone. It's got a really fun combat system, though I do wish it was just a little more challenging.. The game comes with approximately 40+ main missions, with another extra 40 challenges, and then there's the co-op missions, which are also fun, but there's not point in having another friend to do them with you since it's essentially just passing control back and forth between players, and you're not doing anything simultaneously, which is a little disappointing. In all, there's around 60 hours worth of content if you do all of the missions and challenges and co-op missions, in case the amount of content is important to anybody. Though I'd say only around 35 hours worth of that content is doing the truly enjoyable stuff combat related stuff, the other 25 is spent walking around the worlds, which is oftentimes amusing, and the puzzles are fairly okay. While exploring the worlds is amusing, I do wish it had been cut down significantly, since it really doesn't add a whole lot to the experience, and sometimes it's just downright tedious.. My only other complaint would be the little robot thing that guides you throughout your journey. I find it distracting, and I don't find it particularly funny or cute, aside from an occasionally clever line here and there.. Those fairly minor complaints don't detract from the fact that this game contains an incredibly fun and inventive combat system, and it does contain quite a bit of personality and humor. And there's also a sequence that contains what is possibly my second favorite opera singing boss fight of all time (Conker's Bad Fur Day contains the first)",Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Nintendo Switch Standard Edition,0.06876138433515483,0.5148451730418943

Don't be fooled by the silliness though - the game holds your hand for the first hour or so, but then the difficulty ramps up quite a bit!

I have huge hands (easily can palm a professional basketball) and I‚Äôve struggled with ‚Äúesports mice,‚Äù notably the Glorious Model O Wireless. Button placement is great and it‚Äôs perfect for right-handed users.. The Buttons/Clicks: 9/10. The buttons and clicks feel a bit hollower compared to the Deathadder 2013. There‚Äôs just a slight more space needed to register a click. This is not a big issue and I‚Äôve adapted fine. Response times are really quick with the new technology.. The Quality: 10/10. The mouse is really well-built. The rubberized sides feel good. It‚Äôs pretty much the Viper Ultimate specs with a different shell. It‚Äôs lighter than the Deathadder 2013 by 20 or so grams, so overall a great mouse.. The Software: 6/10. Here‚Äôs where everybody dumps their complaints. I know, the software requiring a login is dumb and invasive. It‚Äôs part of a higher-level product offering ploy. The fact that upon first plugging in the mouse, the computer pops up with an install for synapse and slows the computer down. I get it. My advice: setup an account, make your changes to RGB (which mine is off anyway), DPI, polling rate, etc., program multiple profiles using the onboard memory (in this case I have two DPI‚Äôs), then request to delete all of your user data through synapse. Delete account, uninstall synapse, then continue to live your life. You‚Äôll be ok. If your worries about a gaming peripherals company ‚Äústealing and selling your data,‚Äù you‚Äôd be surprised of how much of your information you actually give on a daily basis just walking around in public with your Bluetooth on. Logitech has the same issue, so it‚Äôs rather hard to avoid.. Overall: 9/10. Tl;dr: Great ergo wireless mouse, bad software with easy workaround. Great for people who don‚Äôt like the ambidextrous esports gaming mouse shape.. Highly recommended.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.23573561703996496,0.5018137900746595
2,3.0,"I have had the V2 for about a month now and it feels like a huge improvement over my Deathadder Chroma that died via the double click issue of doom.. Before the pros and con's I want to address a couple of issues you might run into.. First, for the first few days after setting up the mouse every time I would start my pc it wouldn't connect and I would have to unplug it and plug it back in to get windows to recognize it. This was because the Synapse 3 software doesn't for some reason also check for a firmware update for the mouse itself. Quick googling of DeathAdder V2 firmware got me the right link on their website to update it. After that no more issues.. Second issue is a much quicker fix, for those saying they keep changing the dpi via the two top buttons. Just go into the synapse software and under performance you can set the dpi manually to what you want and turn off sensitivity stages which makes the buttons stop changing the dpi.. pros. - super lightweight. - wonderful ergonomics (even for my large hands). - great tracking. - feels sturdy. cons. - software is pretty crap. - Razer support is not gonna support you. - While technically true the mouse has 8 buttons 3 are actually not for gaming. The dpi buttons are only for dpi. I can't assign them to different tasks, and another button is purely for changing profiles on the fly also not a button that can be assigned. So at the end of the day, it's a standard 5 button DeathAdder like all before it. Kinda misleading marketing.. This is actually a great mouse. I have loved using it for the every day or for gaming, but the software and Razer themselves hold it back from being a 5 star product.. Also who needs 20k dpi?!?! honestly",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.24244663382594417,0.5085385878489328
3,5.0,"I'm really impressed, never thought I'd find a high quality gaming mouse for under $50 but this is it. Only two side buttons but that's about all I use anyway, even when there's a bunch of them. You can adjust the DPI in the software instead of having extra buttons on the mouse, which I like as well.. The software that comes with it lets you adjust the brightness of the led and you can set it to sleep after 5, 10, or 15 minutes, or turn it off. Yes I love gaming but I'm not into all that rgb rainbow lighting, gigantic keyboards and mice that look like they came out of a comic book. Clean, white, and softly lit is very pleasing to me (I turned up the brightness for the pic, normally I keep it just a little brighter than the ambient lighting). Glorious PC makes a white mouse for $90 but it doesn't have that simple, aesthetically pleasing look I was going for, it would have looked out of place on my desktop. Now I have to get a white xbone controller and my setup will be complete.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.16494791666666667,0.4373214285714286
4,5.0,"I had an older version of this mouse before it started having problems with its buttons and replaced it with this newer version. It's a great mouse and a good upgrade!. Right away, I should note that you shouldn't get too fooled/confused by the ""8 programmable buttons"" tagline--it's counting every single button on the mouse, including the standard left and right click and buttons to adjust settings on the bottom of the mouse that you would never use during normal gameplay or computer use. The only two ""extra"" buttons on this mouse for gamebinding are the two on the left side you can click with your thumb. The other buttons are: left and right click, the mouse wheel, two buttons underneath the mouse wheel to adjust the DPI of the mouse, and a button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between profiles. So if you're wanting more buttons to use during gameplay--like, say, having an entire MMO hotbar on your mouse--this isn't the right one. It's useful if you just want to have a couple of buttons that are easily accessed though! I like using my mouse buttons for stuff like push-to-talk and melee attacks in FPS games.. As for the changes compared to the previous version of the Deathadder mouse, they're small but for my use they're good QOL changes. The biggest improvement is the spot underneath the side buttons where you're meant to rest your thumb--in the previous version this was a glued-on rubber pad that game off after a year or so or use. In the V2 mouse, it's now a textured part of the rest of the material of the mouse--the only way it's coming off is if the entire mouse case comes off! I could see the texturing being warn a bit, but that's certainly better than my thumb being gummed up by glue after the pad fell off!. The other main change that I've noticed is that I think this mouse is slightly smaller than the previous version. This is great for me, since I'm a woman with small palms and long, thin fingers--I often have problems using gaming mice and controllers comfortably. That being said, I'm not sure if this would be as comfortable for users with larger hands--if you're worried, I'd suggest seeing if you can get measurements for a mouse you find comfortable and then comparing it to the size of this mouse.. I believe the profile and DPI buttons are also new features, although honestly I haven't messed with that much since I'm not experienced with those settings and I haven't needed it for my own gameplaying. It does seem like a good feature and the buttons seem like they're good quality and I've never accidentally pressed them during gameplay, which is great. Probably want to check other reviews if you need more information there.. Looks-wise, this is simple, but pretty looking mouse. The light on the logo and mouse wheel is really colorful but not bright enough to be distracting when the lights are off in the room. It's pretty easy to use Razer's software to change the color to your tastes, or you can leave it on a default setting where it cycles through various colors in a rainbow order. I know there's also a feature that game devs can use to have the mouse colors be manipulated by the game itself, but I've only ever played one game where I know for sure this was implemented--Overwatch changes the color of the mouse based on the character you're playing as. I don't think it's been used by many other games, and honestly I don't find myself looking at my mouse that much while playing anyway--it's probably a feature that's more fun on keyboards.. Overall, I think this is a really great mouse! I recommend it for people that game on their PC or otherwise use their computer enough to want something that has a few more features and/or is a bit more sturdy than a cheaper mouse. If you're a huge tech nerd or want more button options, it might be a better idea to save up for a more expensive mouse. But I think at this price point this mouse has a lot of comfort and control.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.17609789808584989,0.524457135902919
5,5.0,"I'm a faithful Razer mouse customer.. Using Razer Chroma Studio to align Corsair Fans, GSKILL RAM, NZXT LED strip, & my Razer Deathadder is easy once you set them all up to be controlled by Chroma Studio.. - Honestly, I found this out by accident as Corsair & NZXT do NOT play well together.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.5166666666666666,0.8666666666666667
6,5.0,"Pros:. -Light weight (80g). -Left and right Optical switches. -Speedflex cable (very, very nearly a paracord, it's really good for a stock cable). -Focus+ sensor with asymmetric cutoff (more on this). -PTFE skates. -Good scroll wheel. -Snappy side buttons. -Fantastic ergo shape. -Synapse software (more on this). -Bright, clean RGB lighting. Cons:. -No extra skates included. Thoughts:. So the con is the only nitpicky thing I could think of. More companies are starting to include extra skates and other components, and I'd like to see razer do the same. Aside from that, the mouse is fantastic. The buttons are very light to press, the weight is really good, etc.... This is a really good update to a very popular classic. Every gamer at some point has owned a Deathadder and each iteration is slightly better than the previous. This one leaps into the modern trends that gamers are asking for. The cable is so flexible it feels wireless, the weight is so light you won't fatigue your wrist or hand during long sessions, the sensor is very accurate, and so on. Speaking of the sensor, I mentioned asymmetric cutoff. Alot of mice let you adjust the lift off distance, this does that and lets you adjust where it starts tracking when you set it down. A little extra control in the players hands. It also has a smart tracking feature that automatically adjusts the liftoff distance based on the surface. Useful if you play on different surfaces often. The synapse software is not required, but does give you extra control over the mouse. You don't need to register an account to download it or use it. You can log in as a guest, fiddle, and uninstall if you want. Keep in mind, this is a large mouse, so if you have small hands, this probably won't be comfortable to you. It is definitely one of the best ergo shapes available. I'd really like to see razer make these in different sizes. All in all, if you like the deathadder, you'll love this upgrade. If you're in the market for a large ergo mouse, give this a shot.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.26759962850388375,0.4810908476865924
7,1.0,"I would think paying over $100 for a mouse would get me the top of the line. If these was some random cheap mouse, I'd understand. However, after using this for 2 weeks now, playing with all the software, debugging, reading forum posts about it, I can only assume this product is still in beta.. You have to download the synapse software which monitors your mouse settings. Great, but it doesn't work like it's supposed to due to buggyness. Here's the kicker though, repairing and/or reinstalling Synapse will result in random bugs - let me explain. Bug #1 may be present so you go to reinstall and it fixes the issue - but now bug #2 and #3 are present. I've never experienced software that does this, it's baffling.. So far, the bugs I've found were:. -[Maybe not a bug] For the mouse to even be recognized, you have to plug it into a usb using a wired connection first. I'm not sure if this is intended.. -Synapse reports X% battery life but clicking the mouse to go deeper into the settings shows a completely different battery life percentage. Not just a percent or two off, logging into synapse showed my mouse had for example, 90% battery life but when I click the mouse to change its settings, it would display 0% battery remaining.. -Synapse would think it's a completely new mouse depending on the USB port it's plugged into. This would trigger a ""reinstall of required software"" and a restart of the computer even though you have everything you need.. -Disconnects several times a day. Every disconnect I experienced was quick, mostly 1-3 seconds and then it would reconnect.. -When switching between DPIs, in the right corner, there is supposed to be a popup that displays what you switched to. Instead, this rarely ever displays and behavior only gets more weird if you plug the mouse into different USB ports. Reinstalling Synapse made it work for a few hours but then it went back to being buggy.. -Battery life, with RGB off and using ""ultra fast mode"" is more so 25-30 hours than their advertised 70 hours.. I know Razer will likely comment below with a copy paste to contact their support and yet I pretty much have. I've went through many of the help forums, read the responses from Razer, applied their suggestions, and nothing fixes it. Secondly, it's clear to me that most of the issues is in regards to software, not the mouse itself.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.133726035868893,0.5634518655947227
8,1.0,"This is the last time I ever buy a Razer product. I am so sick of discriminatory practices like this. I don't have stable internet, MANY people don't, meaning there's about a 50/50 chance my mouse will STRAIGHT UP NOT WORK the way I've set it up because my computer can't always connect to a stable Internet connection.

All this does is leave your system open to attacks, because you can bet your bottom dollar Razer is selling your data as soon as you connect.

9,5.0,"This is surprisingly a significantly better mouse compared to the V1. I have purchased a lot of razor mice, and had many death adder mice over the years. This version is by far the best that I have tried.. First,. I'm really happy that they removed the side pads and replaced them with something that still feels soft but won't come off. The old pads for your thumb on the left and right of the mouse would come off after about 6 months of use. I would purchase replacement pads and fix it or use epoxy to make a more permanent fix but it was kind of silly that that was such a big pain point. The V2 completely solves that problem.. It also is surprisingly much lighter and it's very noticeable.. I don't know what exactly they've done different with the cable, but for some reason it's a lot easier to ignore it and I very much appreciate it.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.24979591836734694,0.4573356009070295

1,1.0,"Just bought the V2 and I am very happy with the improvements.. To start I will say both versions of this mouse are made for big hands, I have HUGE hands (biggest out of anyone I know) and it feels great. I cannot speak for people with smaller hands, it may still be good.. (CONS ARE FROM MY V1, NOT THE V2) 3 CONS,. 1. Firstly the reason I finally had to buy V2 was because my first deathadder was having some slight misclicking issues. It would double click sometimes when I only clicked once, but very subtle and rare. It was definitely a little loose but still kind of functional, I just like having perfect hardware so I retired the mouse due to the loose buttons (the side buttons were still working fine, just a little looser than new). To be fair, I can be a HARD clicker under stress lol. It lasted about 1.5 years, not too bad.. 2. I know many people had their side rubbers pop off, and mine kind of did but I was able to re-stick it and it pretty much held up. (This was fixed V2, see PROS). 3. The final and biggest issue for me was the peeling tephlon (teflon?) underneath. My edges started to peel which greatly affected the sliding of the mouse until i had to peel them off, round the edges, and reglue it. This solved the problem but on occasion it would continue to bother me. (This was also fixed V2, see PROS). Now on to the PROS,. 1. The side grips and whole mouse texture is MUCH better than V1. The whole plastic surface is slightly roughed up or something, but it makes it feel WAY better in the hand and not greasy/slippery like my old mouse often felt. Also, the side grips are fused with the body of the mouse, so they wont be popping off! Good job razer. They feel better than the old side grips, too. The overall texture also looks more premium in my opinion compared to the first version.. 2. The tephlon (teflon?) underneath is much better; it is thicker with very round corners. I dont suspect to have any problems here, but I will update if I do. Good job again, razer.. 3. List of small pros, but the updated dpi buttons, mouse wheel, and profile selector underneath the mouse help the refreshed look and feel of the mouse. Also, the braided cable is softer and more floppy than V1, so as long as it holds up, I like it better because it doesnt get in the way so far like the old cable sometimes did.. TL;DR the improvements to V2 deathadder are noticeable, but I probably wouldn't recommend a direct upgrade unless you have problems like I did with V1, or if you are rich :D. Overall the perfect mouse for my giant hands.. Edit: after 2 months the left clicker cracked (wont click anymore), not sure how. Contacted razer and they wont cover the damage and will not send me a replacement. Cannot recommend a product that breaks after 2 months and the company won't back you up for it. Will be purchasing a different brand from now on. I had a good opinion of razer, but no longer.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.22251251199780606,0.5256406257141549
2,3.0,"This review is for the Razer DeathAdder v2 gaming mouse. I am updating this review after using the mouse for about a month and a half.. My initial impression of the quality was poor because I had to return the first mouse sent to me due to a wiggly left mouse button that shifted left to right. When I received a mouse without that defect I was impressed by its accuracy and ergonomics. My first review was rather glowing.. After playing a number of games with this mouse over the past month I am retiring it because it performs poorly in Starcraft 2, the popular real-time strategy game. That game involves a lot of rapid fire clicking and the action of the buttons on the DeathAdder is too long, mushy abd inconsistent for it to be an effective RTS mouse. In particular the right mouse button, which is mushier and less predictable than the left, makes rapid Move commands of units much less effective.. As a point of reference, I am comparing it to my previous mouse which I am now using again, a Logitech G502 HERO Wired model. I wanted to replace the mouse simply due to wear and tear on the pads and because Logitechs software is terrible, but the crispness and quick action of the buttons on the G502 make the DeathAdder's buttons feel like a cruel joke.. For certain types of games the longer travel on the DeathAdder is not such a big deal. In CS GO, my performance was actually a bit improved due to the weight, ergo and accuracy of the DeathAdder. Also, the mushier right mouse button is irrelevant in that game. However, I'm playing StarCraft 2 way more often lately, for which the DeathAdder is unacceptable.. To describe the right mouse button: It actuates fairly close to the top of the downward click but then continues to travel way too much. When it bottoms out it does not make a hard stop but instead depresses some dampers that Razer intentionally built in to the button. After the somewhat unpredictable bottom out it rebounds too slowly, and you have to let it rebound a long way for it to actuate again.. This means that when twitching on the right mouse button there are a lot of misses -- non-clicks. By contrast, with my Logitech G502 I can issue right clicks at least twice as fast and never miss a beat. By comparison the DeathAdder has incredibly mushier, long-traveling and unpredictable buttons. Especially the right one.. It isn't a defect in my mouse. I inspected it thoroughly and made an attempt to correct the problem, but it stems from design decisions that Razer made: Over reliance on the plastic shell for button rebound, dampers when the buttons bottom out, long travel with a very quick actuation point.. My initial review gave the DeathAdder 4 stars. I liked the way it performed in FPS games. It is very accurate with smooth tracking with all software smoothing disabled. I deducted one star for poor quality control. I am dropping it to 3 stars because a gaming mouse should really have better thought out, crisper and more predictable primary buttons. The problems with the right mouse button are a death knell for the DeathAdder when it comes to StarCraft 2.. As an aside, the Razer Synapse 3 software is leaps and bounds better than Logitech G Hub, but there is no substitute for good, functional hardware. The next mouse I am trying is on the way: A Logitech G Pro Wireless, which promises crisp buttons in a lighter form factor than that G502, which is a bit of a monster in the weight department. I am cautiously hopeful.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.08048888888888889,0.47507301587301576
3,2.0,"This was my first ever Razer product and I got to say... it's a pretty good mouse for the price. I have a big hand and the mouse is a great fit. The fit, comfortability, and precision of the mouse exceeded my exceptions. And not to mention the satisfying clicks, the smooth programmable buttons on the side, and the tactile scroll wheel. So, you're probably wondering why I gave it a low. Well, Amazon sent me a used Death-Adder. I specifically bought it new from Amazon ( ""shipped and sold from Amazon"" ). So, I'd watch out for that, but honestly that is a rare scenario. I have already returned the mouse and hopefully the Mercury White Edition comes back in stock soon because I'm really hoping to get my hands on it again.. On a side note, people complimented about signing into the Razer software and how they force you to basically hand over your privacy and so on.

5,1.0,"This mouse has one major flaw that's an absolute deal breaker - the left/right mouse click triggers are way too sensitive. I never noticed this before, but I like to rest my fingers on the mouse clicks when I'm using my mouse. Most mice need a bit of force before the trigger is clicked, but the Razer mouse only requires a feather light amount of force to trigger the click. This means I can't rest my hand on the mouse while using it.. Absolute deal breaker considering I use my mouse for both working from home 9 hours a day and gaming afterwards. Not being able to rest my hand while using the mouse means my hand gets really cramped after just a few minutes. Your fingers need to be hovering over the mouse in order to prevent accidental clicks. It's fine if you're gaming for short durations, but for 9 hour work days it's a deal breaker.. This isn't my first Razer mouse either, I also have a Razer Mamba but it's wireless and I wanted a wired mouse, it does not suffer from the same overly sensitive mouse triggers. I didn't get another Mamba because the USB cord that comes with it is only 3ft long.

6,3.0,"At approximately $30, I thought that this mouse was well priced; previously, it was selling for $50-60, which I think it too much for it. I would like to point out three features that stand out to me. (1) This mouse is comfortable in the right hand. It is slightly larger than average, which is a good thing. My hands are average, and smaller mice make me feel like I have to pay attention to where they are all the time, or they will disappear. This mouse does not draw undue attention to itself. Importantly, it is sufficiently wide for the thumb and pinky to rest on it comfortably, and it is raised just the right amount under the base of the index finger. This make it easy to hold without having to squeeze, and the hand rests on it comfortably. This helps make the mouse ergonomic and to feel ""organic"" in the hand. These are this mouse's strongest features, in my opinion. (2) The mouse appears to perform quite well in terms of how the pointer motion ""feels"" on the screen. The coordination between the movement of the mouse and the movement of the pointer is flawless. Before this mouse, I had another highly sensitive mouse set up on my computer, and it was not pretty, although adjusting the software settings helped partially. The transition to this mouse felt like a major improvement, and I only had to weak the pointer speed slightly. The pointer movements feel smooth and precise. (3) I wish this mouse were a little heavier. I also wish that the wheel feet a little more substantial. Both the mouse and the wheel require a tiny bit of effort to move, and this is not enough for my comfort. This is especially problematic with the wheel. The finger slides on the wheel without triggering it, requiring mental effort to press on the wheel to turn it, but not too hard to click it. This is a major disadvantages of this mouse. I would say another 20-40 grams of weight to the body of the mouse would have made all the difference. And a slightly more resistant or rubbery wheel would have made a difference. The relatively lightness of the mouse and low resistance of the wheel draw attention to themselves and take away a sensation of substance that I enjoy in a mouse. That being said, the mouse feels more substantial than your average, cheap, smallish, light, plastic mouse. Some users may prefer their mouse on the lighter side, and some users may like a greasy wheel that is hard to rotate, but I do not.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.09973544973544973,0.5721428571428572
7,4.0,"I've owned several iterations of the Deathadder before buying the v2 (Pro), and I'm coming most recently from the Elite. For other people like me who are familiar with Razer's lineup and thinking about the v2, I just want to point out some differences that stood out to me about their newest model:. - Loud: Clicking is EXTREMELY loud compared to the Elite. It also has a hollow 'pop' tone compared to the Elite's more solid and consistent tone. I'm not sure if the sound will get quieter over time, but even if it does I doubt it will ever be nearly as quiet as the Elite. The side-buttons are a bit louder than the Elite as well. - Shorter and fatter cable: I'm planning to use the v2 Pro mostly wired, and the new cable is a few feet shorter, plus it has a sheath that makes it look much thicker than the Elite'. - Better side-grips: In the v2, the entire side-panel has a textured grip, rather than just the lower half on the Elite. - Lighter: Even with the wireless tech, the v2 is lighter than the Elite. I used to have a Mamba as my travel-mouse which was significantly heavier than the Elite. It's great to have a travel-mouse that doesn't have a lot more weight to account for the battery. - Better scroll wheel: The scroll wheel is actually quieter than the Elite, but feels mostly the same (maybe 10% smoother, but that could just be from wear-and-tear on my Elite)",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.1926677489177489,0.41583694083694084
8,2.0,"The first dumb thing about this mouse is that it requires software to set up and be functional (Razer Synapse). The next even worse thing is that Razer claims it's mac compatible but it's a known issue that they stopped supporting mac several operating system versions ago. So I went through the 30 minute hassle of downloading Synapse, making a Razer account and troubleshooting because the software would not identify the mouse only to read later that mac is no longer supported. Total scam. For those of you who have this mouse already and use mac, I found a lifesaver program called Razer macOS that someone made (it's free, google it) for this exact problem. That will allow you to change DPI and RGB settings but no hotkeys or anything else. For a mouse at this price point it's simply unacceptable that it wouldn't support mac, much less Razer lying about it.

9,5.0,"This is my main. I have the Viper Ultimate and the Viper mini from Razer as well as others from logitech such as the g305, g703 and the model d minus incoming. The Deathadder v2 is the one I perform the best with, no competition.. I play claw and palm/claw with a hand size of 19.1 x 9.9cm and the ergonomics on this thing are hard to get used to, but once you do it's hard to go back to any other shape. I wish there was an EC2 size variant to this because the mini is more like an EC4 and it's too small for me. The DA is slightly on the big side for my grip style but it's still very comfy and lightweight. The side buttons are a little too far forward for me to reliably hit the front side button which is a bummer.. The sensor is flawless and is more reliable than the hero on my G703 which doesn't like a few of my pads (I might've got a defective unit). The clicks are better than the viper ultimate, but not as good as the Viper mini but still good. Optical switches are different but not in a good or bad way just different the pros: they are quick durable and wont double click, the cons: the feedback is different and on the viper ultimate, almost mushy. The side grips are really nice and if you need extra grip try the Razer grips, I highly recommend them. The cable is basically non existent (I have a bungee), i cant feel it. The feet weren't as good as the other new Razers for some reason speed wise. They would also catch my soft pad when swiping left/rear and I count figure out why so I replaced them with tiger arc 2s and they are better for sure. The build quality is very premium without being heavy.. The price is perfect in my opinion. Out of all the mice I own this is the most fairly priced other than the Viper mini.

So I figured I'd get a new mouse that's similar, but the difference is stark.. The feel isn't good. The padded thumb rests are replaced by textured hard plastic. The buttons aren't as responsive.. But the most noticeable thing by far is how garbage the accuracy is. The pointer hitches at slight texture changes in the mousepad. You don't get any fine control, try drawing a small circle with it to test.. The old razer deathadder I had didn't have any of these issues.

The worse part is doesnt even work properly without the software, slow track, have to extend the wrist to move it to the screen at max scrolling speed AND the OS forgets the assigned speed once you close the tab.

If its unplugged and cycles through bios I can plug it back in and it will work. This can be fixed though. I have no control over the mouse due to not having the program installed. The mouse out of box has been working fine for me. Its a great mouse besides the bloatware. I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5 if the program worked!. I had high hopes ordering this mouse as its a pretty good mouse overall for FPS gaming. Then you have to download the program to use the lighting and on board key binds. It was a hassle to get working correctly but finally got it to work. The mouse itself runs great and I love the feel and what you can do with the profiles but I have ran into a major problem. The synapse 3 destroys my internet connection and makes my PC crash. It has to be connected to the internet because its a ""cloud"" based storage system. I have to unplug my mouse and router and plug them back in for it to work. Then it will start ping spiking to 400 MS until the system loses internet and does the whole thing over again.

The feel of this mouse in your hand is amazing and the side buttons are way better quality than Logitech‚Äôs surprisingly. Only thing negative I have to say is that I was having a little issue after over 10,000 hours of use and contacted Razer support. They tried making me take a video of the issue, upload and send to them to show issue for them to replace. Even though my 1 year warranty was still in effect. I was very upset with how they handled the situation but I do love the mouse very much so I sucked it up and just went and purchased a new one from a local dept. store of mine.

There are textured plastic grips, which if you have even a hint of grease, sweat, hand moisturizer, wetness, or anything on your skin it will make moving the mouse a pain in the ass.. It is also clear this mouse was used heavily, as the underside had grime stuck in the area around the optical sensor.. Sadly Amazon does not differentiate the mice listings between versions, so while I gave a 4/5 to the Elite I will override that score to warn people to do fall for the cheap price tag of the Essentials. Pay a few bucks more for the Elite or above, Razer needs to junk these old mice.. I had also reached out to Razer support, who more or less said ""oh, that sucks, did you try contacting the seller?""

The Synapse program for this device integrates seamlessly and automatically with your Chroma version. Programming the mouse is a breeze. The color of the logo and wheel are a pleasant green which can be turned up or down. If you care about colors matching your keyboard all the time you probably want the v2.

8,5.0,"I've upgraded to this after using the Deathadder Elite for about five years. This mouse is almost identical. I was weary because it advertises a new sensor and new switches for the buttons but really, I don't think I can tell any difference. If you need 20K DPI you're crazy. There's no reason to upgrade to this from the Elite. The new feet/skis/pads made a bigger difference than anything. The only reason I bought this was because my Elite M1 and scroll wheel was starting to fail.. Which brings me to my next topic: warranty. I didn't even bother contacting Razer warranty (Who knows... maybe they would have surprised me) and it's no secret that Logitech has a pretty good customer service satisfaction, at least by comparison. Many of the Razer and Logitech mice use the same sensors and thus perform very similar. Even though I find Razer longevity lacking compared to Logitech, I still come back to Razer because I prefer how tracking algorithm works compared to Logitech. That's not to say the tracking on modern Logitech mice are not also fantastic. In most ways, I find it comes personal preference these days.

It's a standard green light-up, and it doesn't change, but the ergonomic feel of the mouse is decent so far, I've had it a couple of days as of yet. I assigned the left-side buttons to set the speed control of the DPI, but it's not working too well, like it did on my Razer Naga, which had specifically two buttons FOR the DPI settings. I'm hoping Razer works on fixing it so I can go back to being to switch sensitivity of the DPI for when I'm trying to shoot people in-game between a close range and being able to turn around lightning fast, versus being able to slow down and line up a shot on my target from 300m away....

A mouse, whether or not it's expensive or in-expensive, need feet that glide smoothly on a mousing surface. This mouse consistently made a noticeable grinding noise across a hard surface mouse pad (steelseries gaming mouse pad), where other mice do not have any issues.

6,5.0,"As a person who coveted price over performance for many years, I have owned a plethora or mice in the budget discount market. Feeling that if I spent a third of the price of name brand mice, and still got 2-3 years of use, then I was winning the game so to speak.. After my last mouse started not registering clicks at the most inopportune times, I finally realized that I needed to look at a quality mouse. That's where the Razer Deathadder Essential comes in. What a world of difference!. The Good: Size. It is LARGE. For someone with larger hands, typical mice in the budget category were often just adequate to just a bit too small. The Deathadder fits and feels like a substantial extension of my hand.. Weight. The Deathadder is heavy. Not ridiculous heavy, but heavy enough you feel you are moving something. I happen to love this about the Deathadder. It gives me the weighted feedback that I am moving the mouse in a way that I want, not by accident because it was too light and it lifted and shifted it's position because of a minute twitch of my wrist.. Adjustable: Having multiple dpi and mhz settings allows me to fine tune the Deathadder to suit my use case needs. 5 settings will be all you need to choose what works best for you.. The Bad: Lighting. The single color lighting would be nice if I could adjust that single color to fit the theme of my setup instead of just the Razer Green.

0,5.0,"Like a lot of folks, I have young kids (8 and 6) doing virtual classrooms right now. They did not use PC's a lot before COVID, and I wanted to give them the best possible experience to help keep them motivated. I'll say this right now - both kids loved it. They liked how easily it glides, the weight, the size and - of course - the fact that it can light up. They aren't competitive gamers so we're not using the included grip stickers.. One interesting feature was that one kid likes to keep the logo one color and the other likes the colors to change - and with the Razer Synapse3 software, both can be accommodated. If you are working with kids you will want to change the DPI settings to just 1 or 2 settings though (from the default 5)... 6400-DPI and kids are not compatible.. Versus the previous standard/basic optical mice, the difference was noticeable even for the kids. The mouse is lighter, glides more easily, and is more comfortable for their hands. Lighting and DPI changing capabilities are bonuses.. From the perspective of the adult.... I've used a full-size Razer DeathAdder on my desktop for a few years now, so I feel like I can give a pretty good comparison of the full-size versus the mini. In short, the mini really is just a smaller DeathAdder in terms of feel with just 2 changes.. The first (and smallest) change is that the scroll-wheel trim does not light up like it does on the full size (the logo still glows though).. The second change is the DPI-shifting button... singular. The full-size has two buttons - DPI-up and DPI-down; the mini has just one that scrolls up to max then restarts at the bottom. Having to scroll through the whole way would be detrimental in some fast-action gaming situations, but as people generally leave DPI static after starting a game it's probably minimal. Otherwise, the button feels a tad cheaper than the ones on the full-size, but I don't think it's functional... it's probably just a larger physical pad mounted on the same switches. Since the DPI-shifter is by far the least-used button, I think this is OK..

1,5.0,"To start this review off I want to say I didn‚Äôt have crazy high hopes for this mouse. I knew it was going to be good overall but not great. When I got it in hand the weight is amazing. Light, but heavy enough so it doesn‚Äôt lift up while gaming. The whole mouse is extremely well designed with buttons that are placed ergonomically for a more comfortable and efficient play. The mouse has good rgb and has a nice and subtle click. The best part in my opinion is the response time and braided cable. It has a similar actuation design as the huntsman elite keyboard (I also have that and love it) which makes it lighting quick to commands. For a game like fortnite which needs quick commands and actions it does the job exceptionally. The braided cable is well designed and glides smoothly on a mouse pad. Overall great mouse.

3,5.0,"My previous Razer DeathAdder died, so I ordered a replacement. The v2 has the same comfortable size, weight, and (right-handed) grip of the previous model. The mouse is a little on the large side, meaning I can rest almost my entire hand on the mouse comfortably. The two teflon pads on the bottom of the mouse are generously sized compared to the three tiny pads on some other mice.. The 20,000 DPI sensor is much more sensitive than I'm used to. However, using all of those 20,000 DPI seems to require that you install the Razer Synapse software, since the stock profiles only go up to 3,200 DPI. With the software, you can customize sensitivity profiles easily.. The v2 advertises eight total programmable buttons. One of those buttons is a profile control on the underside of the mouse, and two are dynamic sensitivity adjusters under the scroll wheel. The sensitivity adjusters can be rebound to different functions, but Synapse only supports button numbers up to 5, so if you want to customize buttons 6 and 7 then you'll need to bind them to a macro, text, or other advanced function. The two thumb buttons are comfortable to use. Clicking down the scroll wheel requires a little more force than I'd like, but the ""click"" isn't mushy the way many scroll wheels often are.. The LED lighting on the Razer logo and scroll wheel is full-RGB, rather than the green-only of the previous model. It's highly customizable in software as well..

4,5.0,"Got my first Razer Deathadder way back in 2010, lasted 9 long years before it finally kicked the bucket (despite a thorough cleaning). Switched to a wireless Logitech mouse after a little while of not gaming, which only lasted about 3 months before the laser started messing up. Went back to Razer and bought this and have no idea why I ever strayed away.. Pros:. -Grippy surfaces where they should be. -great feeling buttons. -good weight. Cons:. -A little bulky, definitely meant for larger hands (which I have). -DPI switching buttons are a little hard to tell from each other if you don‚Äôt look at the mouse. -Razer software can be slow. 5 stars because honestly, the pros outweigh the cons.

5,4.0,"Ive had the mouse for 2 months now and this is probably the most comfortable mouse in my hand that I have ever bought. The soft but hard texture of the mouse is amazing. Combine that with how your fingers feel encompassed by the buttons with the ergonomic design and it makes for a very enjoyable experience. When I lay my hand on the mouse it feels natural, and apart of my hand, instead of my hand just simply laying on top of it, if that makes sense. And the RGB on the mouse is dope, and in moderation. Top that off with a 50$ price point and I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.. I take away 1 star for 4 small reasons that are not deal breakers, but could use some improvement or just things I dont prefer.. 1. The 2 buttons for the thumb are too far foward. Instead of my thumb resting in the middle of the 2 buttons making it easy to hit either one, my thumb rests on the center of the button closest to me forcing me to have to stretch my thumb up to the front of 2 the buttoms. Ive gotten used to it now, and it may not be an issue for some, but its something to keep in mind. Also I have big hands, Im a 300lb male (I use this account for prime) and im 6'4 so it isnt a ""small hands"" issue the buttons are just legitly too far forward.. 2. There is a slight deadzone when you left click. Not sure if this is really a con, as I believe it has helped me with miss clicking less. However I do prefer an immediate click with no give in the button. None the less it was nothing to get used to it and now I dont even notice it. In fact, it could have even been a calculated design to help with miss clicking since the button itself doesnt need much force to activate a click. Either way, it took some getting used too and is not what I prefer, but its still good.. 3. The scroll wheel is not great. This doesnt mean much as most mice I have had didnt have a great scroll wheel. It just feels... cheap and doesnt always like to ""lock in"" to place sometimes if you are lightly scrolling on the wheel. Not a major deal though as I said most mice Ive had didnt have great scroll wheels.. 4. Most mice have a ""sound"" to them while clicking. This mouse sound a bit hollow. When you click it sounds like it resonates in the body of the mouse. I came from a Logitec g203 prodigy mouse and the sound of that mouse made the mouse sound well built, not hollow. Again this is not a deal breaker nor a major issue but it is something to keep in mind.. Pros:. - Most comfortable mouse in my hand I have ever owned. - Very accurate and amazing for gaming. - I got it for 49.99 so it was a great deal for such a comfortable, accurate mouse. - +200fps because the mouse has RGB :). Cons:. - Thumb mouse buttons are a bit too far forward on the mouse. - Very slight ""deadzone"" when left clicking but nothing serious or anything to worry about. - The ""sound"" of the mouse/clicks sound hollow. Makes the mouse ""sound"" cheaper. But its lightweight so... - Scroll wheel feels, cheap",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Classic Black,0.22270502645502654,0.5052147896195514
6,1.0,"(TLDR at bottom). Pictured is my new mouse (already wrapped up ready to be sent back) next to my old mouse (broken scroll wheel and I'm still choosing it over the razor mouse). Deathadder v2 is significantly larger than the Logitech G302 yet the G302 weighs 1.5Xs more. Deathadder honestly feels like I could crush it in my hand. Feels incredibly cheap, and was awful to try and use in terms of control on screen as well. The back angles down so steep I would honestly rate it a 0 for ergonomic. Your hand wants to naturally slide off the back of the mouse rather than rest on top. Its WAY more effort than it should be to keep ahold of this mouse. I lost all patience with it in less than 5 minutes and put it back into the box to be sent back. It has a nice cord though?!???. TLDR:. Only pro I can think of is its cord flexibility.. YoU cAn CHaNge ItS CoLoRs. Cons:. WAY to lightweight (unless you like that?). Feels like it cost 10 cents to make, doesn't even feel nice in your hand..

So for example you run out of ammo in game and want to switch to your secondary.. well you'll switch to it but switch right back about 3 times.

1,1.0,"This would be a wonderful mouse other than the constant click/double click issue. The first one I had for a very short time. During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly. Amazon was great and provided an exchange. During the time I had the new one, I was not doing as much gaming/designing so the click issue took longer to show up. I am convinced this is a design flaw in the mouse itself. I will not purchase another one of these. The price is not worth it at all with the click issue. To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks. I have tested this extensively. If it wasn't for that issue, this mouse would be wonderful. However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.19692760942760945,0.41520622895622894
2,4.0,"Let me start by saying that I've used a lot of gaming mice, like, over 50 of them. The Logitech g502 was always a quality mouse and tons of people love the thing just based on the design and overall quality of the mouse; That being said, there are a few things to consider if you're thinking about getting this one in particular.. The Pros of this mouse are fairly straightforward, and are as follows:. - Comfortable shape for most right handed people, but should be more comfortable for people with medium to large size hands.. - Good build quality which easily places it in the same category as other 'premium' around this price point or even a bit higher.. - Scroll wheel: this is one of my personal favorite features of the mouse. Allows infinite scroll to get through annoying EULA pages quicker and also quickly raise or lower volume on YouTube or other video streaming sites, but without sacrificing the much needed precision of the standard mouse wheel steps. Feels satisfying to use, but it is made of metal, which leads to a negative I'll be mentioning later on.. - Sensor: The Logitech Hero sensor has been tested numerous times and found to be roughly on par with the PMW3360 series sensors (including the 3366 on the original g502) while being advantageous for usage in wireless mice due to the lessened draw of power which allows for a longer battery life.. The Cons of this mouse make it hard to recommend to everyone, and are why I don't usually recommend it as a first choice.. -Weight: My god. This thing is one of the heaviest mice I've used for an extended period of time. I don't know exactly how much this weighs, but it feels pretty similar to the original, which I believe weighed in a little over 130 grams. Most gaming mice target a weight of 100g or LIGHTER, since lowering the weight of the mouse will make extended use easier and will allow for a greater degree of control.. - Not a truly ""safe"" shape, this may or may not matter to you, but I felt that it's worth mentioning. Obviously this is a mouse for right handed people, and it may not necessarily be a great fit for you if your hands are very small (I have very small hands and cannot reach the sniper button at all, but the mouse is still comfortable).. I would say it's a top tier mouse, but only if you can look past the weight. I would recommend that, as always, if you have the ability to do so, you should go to a local store and try some of the mice out to see which feels best to you, and make your decision after you have an idea what type of mouse shape you want.. I won't recommend that you do or don't buy a product, so I'll leave it at that.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.15527056277056278,0.4728484848484848
3,1.0,"It seems logitech has either a quality control problem or a supply problem because the switches in these mice are absolute garbage. The mouse is honestly one of the best mice I have ever used while it worked - until it didn't. Less than a year old and $75 gets you a mouse that feels great in the hand until the scroll wheel starts jumping around and the left click starts randomly double clicking, and then not clicking at all - all intermittently. There are numerous reviews out there one can find by simply googling ""g502 double click"" in which people either return them and hope their next one doesn't do the same, refund them, or the more technical self swap of a mechanical switch for the left click.. I will not be going any of these routes and I'm sad to say it because Logitech used to be a staple in PC peripherals. Now it's not the plastic it's made of.. edit: As I write this update, I have actually taken another star off for the true, 1 star review. I typically don't believe in one star reviews because it's generally an overreaction and everything is either 5 stars great or 1 star horrible, but Logitech has sunken to the 1 star territory. After literally 15 emails back and forth with Logitech support, I had to use their website to prove I was having a double click issue, which was easily done, but had to film both myself, the mouse, and the serial number from the mouse in the video while doing it. I could easily reproduce the double click fault in both the left AND right click function and sent proof. I sent my mouse back to Logitech on approx the 10th of January 2020. They received my mouse the 15th of January 2020. I don't hear anything for 8 days until I first contact them again asking for an update. Still nothing. Finally I receive an email stating that my product is not faulty, and therefore doesn't qualify for the warranty. Nevermind the evidence I had to first email them. Nevermind the 100% reproduce able error in both left and right clicking.. I will never buy a logitech product again.. Do yourself a favor and google 'logitech double click' and question whether you want to buy this mouse, likely have the issue, and then not have the warranty honored.

6,5.0,"This review is for the Hero version of G502. I have stopped using Logitech mice since they discontinued G9. I have been using Roccat Kone XTD since then that died after serving me for over 5 years. After reading reviews about G502 I decided to give it a try as I really liked the overall design and feel , it reminded me of G9.. So when I learned they are refreshing the 502 with a new sensor I was skeptical to pay $30 more for the new one. Now that I used it I am glad I did. The refreshed model has a really thick and flexible cord that was apparently a major weakness in the original 502. Couple that with a really awesome sensor that is super accurate and sensitive to slightest movements and tracks on any surface (seriously I tried everything from a white paper to the palm of my hand) and you have a potential winner. However, the best part of this mouse is not that or the the materials that they used which also feels really nice and durable.. While subjective and relevant to how big or small your hands are for me the way the mouse sits in my hand and how easy it is to access the buttons are the best indicators . The buttons themselves feel very satisfying to press thanks to the spring loaded mechanism. Last but not least is the scroll wheel. This... this scrollwheel I can probably write a whole paragraph on how good it is... Not only does it have the infinite mode that rolls beautifully but also its made from METAL. Its a nice chunk of metal that is just better than a plastic one in every way. I dont think I can go back to plastic mouse-wheels after using my G502. You might never use the 16000DPI sensor but if you used G502 and similar mice in the past and are due for an upgrade the refresh 502 is totally worth the money Logitech is asking for.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.26171401515151516,0.5606439393939393

((FAILED)) LEFT MOUSE BUTTON FAILURE - The older version I have is more reliable after 3 years. Logitech products across the board are having durability issues. Their OLDER 2015 - 2018 Products were far superior. Not sure what is going on with their design and quality control, but after MANY years and thousands of dollars of products there is a noticeable DROP in QUALITY & more specifically DURABILITY. ((Possibly they are too trick for their own good). 1.) The cord is much better, but this mouse still has one. (It's hard to find CONS with the G502 HERO.). 2.) Really miss the cordless days, but this mouse catches every signal & the slightest movements.. 3.) The RGB is usually not prominent as it's under your hand or in sleep mode.. 4.)

I don't use them to their full potential, but the few macros I have are awesome!. FINAL NOTE: My first G502 is still rock solid even after years of abuse, nothing has failed. Mouse wheel is 100% & so is the weight latch.. I hated Logitech until I used the 502's, their mousewheels fail, wireless signal loss is constant (with exception to the $100 wireless lasers.)

8,2.0,"I really wanted to love this mouse. This style of form factor, with a nice little ledge for your thumb to rest on, doesn't get enough love from mouse OEMs. I also am a contrarian in still liking heavier mice, despite the recent trend in favor of ultra-light mice, and this thing feels nice and solid with the weights added. Finally, I really liked that the mouse is WIRED. Having run the gamut of wireless mice, I have found no matter what the claims are, they always are prone to connection glitches and, even when they work well for a time, are a PITA to always remember to keep charged. The new hero sensor is also awesome.. Because of these desirable properties I lived in a state of denial about the mouse's many glaring flaws for months.. Sadly, I am out of denial and into grief.. The main issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel. It just sucks. The mouse semi-regularly just decides the scroll wheel is being clicked, resulting in lots of odd behavior. And then it's hard to know when you've successfully clicked the scroll wheel down, because it requires so much actuation force and yet has so little travel.. The free-wheeling mode of the scroll wheel is reasonably nice, with a satisfying long spin, but it's almost impossible not to occasionally click the button that puts it back into incremental scrolling mode. This is a big deal, because the incremental scrolling mode is unbelievably ghastly and thus something you would never use voluntarily The tactility feels all wrong--both too abrupt/tactile and not sticky enough for something that is so abrupt/tactile. At the same time, the scroll wheel actually rattles because of the force of the increments--but only like maybe half the time. The combination of these features induces an overall sensation of unpredictability and randomness along with an unpleasant sound.. A less critical but still painful flaw is the button placement. The idea of a little ledge sticking out is to use a palm grip and rest your thumb there, right? One would think so. However, doing so places one of the other two main side buttons totally out of reach. You have bend your thumb back so hard to reach back button that it basically means only a claw grip is truly comfortable--in which case the thumb ledge goes unused.. So, all in all, yeah I think Logitech should go back to the drawing board and generate this style of mouse with different button placement and a much more nicely tuned scroll wheel.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.05386101272464912,0.5061360356814901

I did not want to spend another $99 on that and hopped this mouse would work better.. The good:. - It is a nice looking mouse from outside. The bad:. - Right out of the box, this mouse started randomly double clicking or needed to click multiple times for it to react.. - On free-wheel mode, it just scrolls with the movement of the mouse, even if the wheel is not moving at all.. - Not at all ergonomic, it will hurt your hand after 10 minutes using it. The back is too narrow, no support for the right side of your hand, and to hold it properly you have to close your hand in an awkward way.. - Both options of the software to program/change settings are unnecessarily intrusive on your computer, and every 30 minutes or so, make it go sluggish with the mouse barely responding.

0,1.0,"Purchased this mouse on July 2nd and as of the day of this review the mouse went from being a 5 to a 1. I really expected so much more out of Logitech and incredibly upset that in less then a month the mouse is already giving me issues. I purchased this mouse to replace my old razer deathadder which lasted me for approximately 3 years. I figured since I already owned the G402 that it would make sense to upgrade to a G502 and give it a shot with the weights feature. The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about. So when I play Overwatch I play A LOT of widow and recently the right click would always double click as I'm sitting there scoped in. It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly. So if you're looking for a game that you need to scope STAY AWAY. The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews. So again, if you need to hold your clicks, keep searching for another mouse. Shame on you Logitech :(","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.06839826839826842,0.4267316017316018
1,1.0,"Loved this mouse for 3 months, absolutely everything. Then one day it started to randomly double click on the right mouse button, but only maybe once per 1,000 clicks, no big deal right? Wrong. This escalates and quickly becomes to 1 in every 10 clicks just a month after you notice the first double click issue starting. Being a ""gaming mouse"", and a reputable company, I expected more. I took the time to write the review now because after 4 months with my right click double clicking every 1 out of 10 clicks the left mouse button has started the 1 out of 1,000. My fear is that in another month I'll have the same issue with the left click. This mouse is already un-usable for gaming as any fps with scopes become unplayable as you cannot reliably ADS or hold scopes in fear that it will double click and make you lose ADS or lose your scope.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.10638528138528137,0.39843073593073586
2,1.0,"This was a really great mouse prior to it developing a double left click issue under a year of use. I did some digging online and found that this seems to be due to their mouse switches.. I've been a big Logitech fan since the G15 and G9 days. I'm currently still using a G13 and G910 but I will be avoiding Logitech mice going forward. I'm currently thinking about going back to Razer mice due to this cheaping out on the switches issue to save a few dollars.. Logitech, if you are reading this: if you need to charge an extra 5 dollars to put great switches in your mice, then DO IT! Making cheap products like this only hurts your brand and will make people move away from you. I went from Razer mice to Logitech because their mice had a fraying issue with their cords and Logitech was one of the first to start making them with a reinforced wire to prevent it! Looks like I'm going back to Razer as the tables have turned now. Fix your products Logitech!. I'm just glad I still have my older G502 Proteus Core and Proteus Spectrum mice to fall back on for the time being as those had switches that don't seem to have the issue.. RMA is not worth it to me as I've read the review people have had them go bad again due to their bad switches. It's not worth my time and or money of sending this back and forth.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.03477564102564104,0.33173076923076916
3,2.0,"I've always loved Logitech products, and have used them for decades because of their quality and customer service.. But this mouse, even when it's working, is just above average for a gaming mouse IMO. It has high DPI settings which is nice, but mostly useless because not many people even get close to touching those settings. They're far too sensitive for the vast majority of people.. The main problem with this mouse is quality. It'll last you between 6 months and a year before the left click stops working properly. There have been issues with left click problems for YEARS on Logitech mice, and it doesn't seem like they've done anything to try to fix the problem.. I have 4 versions of this mouse in my house. My girlfriend has the previous non-Hero version, and that worked great for about 2 solid years of very light use before it started having issues. When you click, it double clicks. It's very frustrating and annoying.. I built my daughter a computer a year ago, and got her the Hero. It worked great at first, so I decided to get me one too. Mine lasted until the RMA period was over, and then the left click stopped working. Not the typical double click problem though. Mine can't register a click+hold for long. So when you try to drag an icon on your desktop to the trash, it'll just keep dropping the icon in random places. If you try to bookmark a tab in your browser? Drag it half way and it'll suddenly let go of the tab and create a new browser window out of the tab. Try to drag mail to a folder in Outlook? It'll probably let go of the mail and drop it in the wrong folder, etc... If you have to click+hold in a game to register an action? It won't work.. At this point, my daughters mouse was still working, so I thought maybe I just got a defective mouse. I went to Fry's (instead of buying on Amazon this time, because I was in a hurry) and bought the exact same mouse. It hasn't even been 6 months and it already has the same exact problem.. All 4 of our Logitech mice, similar make and model, have all had problems with the left click. All of them purchased from different places over 2+ years of time. The problems I'm having aren't just a fluke. They're not a result of getting a unlucky bad mouse. There's a very good chance if you buy this mouse, you'll have similar problems within a year, even with light use. As a gaming mouse, this thing should be able to stand up to abuse, but it'll break even with light use. That makes it a BAD gaming mouse, and a bad mouse in general. Even writing this review, I tried to highlight some text to copy/paste it to another section, and I can't even do that. I had to hold shift+arrow keys to highlight the text because my mouse will just delete it or move it to some random places while I'm still holding left click/dragging. Ugh.. On top of that, this mouse is fairly skinny and does not fit large hands very well. It's not comfortable at all unless you have fairly small hands. The Corsiars M65 was a much better fit for large hands, and is just as good as the G502 in pretty much every way except looks, and far better in terms of quality/longevity.. As an old school Logitech fanboy, it makes me really sad to write this review.. Don't buy this mouse. There's 10-20 other gaming mice out there that are just as good, and better quality. Look elsewhere.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.06657924326755496,0.46066045426435037

5,3.0,"I was a big fan of Logitech, all the mice that I have purchased for all my computers since the 1990's have been either Logitech (95%) or Razer (5%) and ive had over 20 mice over the years. I dont mistreat my mice, the reason that I usually end up replacing mice is because a newer one comes out with more buttons or features and I replace my current mouse. Unfortunately on the Logitech G502 Hero the left mouse button starts to malfunction and to click an extra time or wont hold the left mouse button down when I have my finger held down on it (to drag objects on the screen) it will release the button without me letting go of the button effectively making it impossible to drag objects across the screen. The left mouse button will also start experiencing issues where it starts to click more than the times that you actually clicked, 1 click will register as 2-3 clicks and double clicking will register as if you clicked 4+ times.. The Logitech G502 Hero that I purchased from Amazon for $68.29 on 04/18/2019 started experiencing the dreaded extra clicking and unable to hold the left mouse button down issues on 03/30/2020 (a little less than a year after purchase) and I contacted Logitech support which then had me follow several troubleshooting steps and film a video of the issue with my phone's camera and send it to them. Logitech replaced the original defective mouse for free on 04/05/2020 but now on 01/15/2021 the replacement mouse that Logitech sent me is starting to experience the same issue agian with the left mouse button clicking extra times and releasing the left mouse button when I have my finger held down without me letting go of the button, thats the second G502 Hero thats failed in under a year.. Almost all the 20+ mice that I have purchased since the 1990's have been Logitech (95%) which were excellent quality and the other 5% have been Razer mice which were not as good as the Logitech mice and were overpriced. I dont really think its worth it to spend $50+ on a mouse and then have it fail at 12 months or less so this time I purchased a $20 Asus TUF M3 to replace my $68.29 Logitech G502 Hero, at least if the Asus mouse starts having the same issue at a year or less I only spent $20 on it. I hope that Logitech quality improves in the future because I was reading 3 star and under reviews online for the Logitech G502 Hero and the issues that I am experiencing seem to be pretty common (it seems that the sensor that registers the clicks is made in China and is poor quality) some people mention that they replaced the sensor that registers mouse clicks with a Japanese sensor and it got rid of the issues but im not technical enough to open up the mouse, find the replacement part online, and then put it in the defective mouse so ill just buy a replacement $20 mouse from Asus.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",-0.023685515873015876,0.32227182539682536
6,2.0,"I ignored the reviews that reported the double-click issue. There's been times I've bought products others said were defective and never had a problem, so I figured I would still get it. That was just gambling for quality, trying to beat the odds. Boy, is my face red. Bought at the end of April, double-clicking severely by October. Trying to do anything with this mouse is now a hassle. Most games are unplayable. If I click once, I need it to register one click. Not two, three, or more. I contacted Logitech support, as it is under warranty. After about a week they responded with a process that almost completely would absolve them of having to follow through - jumping through hoops with steps up to and including a click testing website where you have to record video with your phone and send it to them to prove it. I'm not going to deal with such an absurd process, so while they may have saved on having to honor the warranty, they've lost a customer. I'll never buy a Logitech product again. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Don't buy this. You will get the same issue, almost guaranteed.. Aside from the issue above, the mouse has programmable DPI settings. Which is nice, and only necessary because the default settings are weirdly too fast or too slow. The buttons to change the DPI settings is in a spot where I constantly hit them accidentally, which is annoying, but I think that's more a me problem. The RGB lights change colors, but the mouse doesn't remember that until the Logitech software you need to have is turned on. The mouse wheel either spins freely, which is stupid, or turns into a chunky megalithic clickmonster if you lock it. The scroll left/right by moving the mouse wheel left or right doesn't really work correctly. Neither does pressing in the mouse wheel to scroll up or down by holding it. It just stops. Very frustrating.. Decent heavy duty cord, ergonomically ok, comfortable at least. You can change the little weights inside but I'll be honest, unless you're some kind of die-hard gamer playing semi-professionally I can't see any reason someone would need that. Ultimately, I give the whole thing two stars; it probably would have been four but it loses one for the multi click problem almost everyone seems to get, and another for the unbelievable burden their support places on people to discourage anyone from actually being able to get a fix or replacement under warranty. Bad business, that. Again - don't buy this. Odds are a cheap no-name brand would last longer.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.01719361387966039,0.5658822443706165
7,1.0,"I still have my MX518 from 15 years ago and the only think that has gone bad is the cable, which I easily replaced with a quick search online. I just wanted a nice upgrade as I still own the MX (and going strong) This piece of junk started to malfunction barely before the year mark (supposedly they use omnron switches marketed for a gazillion actuation life). I am a casual gamer and the only one who uses my computer is me, so I know the device was not abused in any way or form.. Logitech support is a joke. After wasting 2 hours trying to have a representative online, they were not able to process my RMA because their ""system"" was not able to process my serial number. So no, they just gave me a phone number. I called the phone number and it was a labyrinth of menus until finally I was able to reach the correct team. Waited and waited until I hung up exactly 15 minutes after no one replied. Take my advice and don't waste your hard earn money in a company that can't stand behind their products.

8,5.0,"I've had my Logitech G500 for so long, I can't even remember using another mouse unless I was at one of those *shudder* shared workstations. But, like all good things, electronics must come to an end. I chose the G502 Hero to replace my beloved G500 and am rather happy with this little guy. I'm not a gamer, I use this mouse for work mostly doing data analysis and TSQL, so my wants & needs are quite a bit different than most.. Pros:. - Since the weights are customizable, I still get to have the nice heavy mouse I've always loved.. - Granular DPI adjustments let me set up the speed just how I like it and lets me pick and choose just the right places for the 9,485 screenshots I need to take daily to show people why they're wrong.. - All buttons are able to be unassigned, so if you're not a gamer and you're worried about hitting the wrong thing, don't, it's not a big deal.. - The lighting is totally customizable, so if you don't want to see cool glowing lights on your mouse, don't. If you think it's cool, have fun.. - Still ergonomic as ever. I use mine with an old IMAK ergoBeads wrist pad and no pain.. - The cord is REALLY LONG, so if your main desktop/laptop/docking device is far away, it's not a problem.. Cons:. - I prefer to have a clicking scroll wheel (you can also choose to have the scroll wheel free-scroll with the push of a button). It's kind of loud. Not loud enough to bother anyone while I'm scrolling on a conference call, but louder than the G500.. - The bottom part to get to the weights is a little difficult to remove. Once it's set though, you don't need to worry about it anymore..

9,1.0,"From the standpoint of how this mouse feels, it is amazing. In the short period of time it actually works it is wonderful. Having said that, from a quality aspect it is a pile of flaming trash.. I am now on my second G502 Hero mouse. Both have the exact same problem where the left mouse button starts double-clicking for any presses after about 3 months of use and therefore holding the mouse button does not work.. Additionally, now that Logitech has reduced capacity due to COVID getting in touch with a person is impossible and the warranty submission and ticket creation systems DO NOT work. Both take me directly back to the product page creating an endless cycle. I also tried the ""Support Bot"" and go to the point where it asked if I wanted to create a ticket, but it just shows a repeated progress meter like it is going to do something and never actually completes.. While not directly related to this issue, I also had a Logitech K810 keyboard fail, which was BEFORE COVID and the device was quickly replaced (when I could actually reach someone); however, it was within a 3 month period of having purchased that product as well.. I have used Logitech products since the 1980s, but given this many failures in such short periods of time I cannot and will not recommend using their products any longer.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.06333333333333334,0.37499999999999994
0,4.0,"The mouse specs are straight forward, and covered in the description of the product. However, as a side note, there was no noticeable performance increase with the hero sensor compared to their last generation. That was to be expected since Logitech already had phenomenal sensors so any difference is probably on the test results not human use.. That being said, I'll just do a quick pro, con list.. Pros:. - Solid construction. - good button placement. - buttons are light, and crisp. - Decent support software whether that is Logitech gaming software or the hub.. - Comparable price to competitor mice with similar features.. Cons:. - Scroll wheel is not rubberized like the G900 and is very hard to grip.. - There is no comfort groove in the right mouse button like there is with the left (preference). - Mouse is heavy, even without the weights. If you like to do flick shots or lift your mouse up you may feel fatigue over time compared to other Logitech mice that weigh around 75grams.. - Edit: There is no support for forward and backward scroll wheel as buttons in their software per this review. Would be nice to have like Roccats swarm software.. Conclusion: This is a well priced product. The sensor is incredible, comparable to other brands such as Roccat, Razer, and Steel Series (among others like Zowie). It is heavy, more for larger hands, and the scroll wheel could have been rubber for grip. I'll personally use this for MOBAS and RTS but it is far too heavy for dedicated fps like Overwatch and COD. I'd personally recommend the Logitech G Pro/Pro Hero if you are an FPS player that needs fewer buttons.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.1288052721088435,0.4764243197278912
1,3.0,"I am unfortunately replacing a mouse I really liked, the Corsair M65, which suffered from a way too early failure. I've used Logitech mice forever and they just keep going, so that'll likely be the last time I venture off to another brand. Comparing these two, they have a very similar size, look and feel. This one is nearly as heavy without the weights as was the M65 with all three weights. I think I liked the M65's aluminum construction a bit better, but the plastic on this one doesn't leave anything to be desired and the grippy material on this mouse sides is a nice touch. This unit's button placement is far superior over the M65, I don't find myself inadvertently activating any buttons like I did with the Corsair. The scroll resistance on this mouse wheel is also a bit better, very defined clicks and it's also adjustable to free spin if desired. It is comfortable enough to use as an every day mouse and has optional features that can be used for gaming. Overall, I think this is a better mouse than the Corsair and so long as it holds up, I'll keep my review at 5 stars.. Update: I'm starting to think these rather expensive gaming mice are just a cash grab. The middle mouse button on this one failed to scroll properly after only 29 days of use. Thank goodness I was still within the Amazon return window. Mice have been around for a long time and the tech to make them reliable has also been around for a long time. Something is wrong with the middle mouse button on these gaming mice, this is the second one from two different companies to fail shortly after purchase. I'll get this one replaced, but my next mouse is going to be a cheap one. At least they work reliably for a good long time. This is unacceptable to have premature failures like this on $50 mice when the $12 special will go for a decade.. Update 2: The replacement mouse has held up so far, so I'm upgrading the review stars a bit. I do have semi-frequent problems with dust getting stuck in the laser's sensor area. When this happens, I get really bad tracking and have to blow on it to clear whatever's in there. Not super inconvenient, but also not a ""feature"" that I've seen from any other mouse that I've used in 20 years.. Update 3: Middle mouse wheel failed at about 16 months, back down to 1 star. I'm done with these expensive mice. I've had mice last 10+ years, but can't get a single ""high-end gaming mouse"" to last even 2 years. I'm either the unluckiest guy ever, or I suspect these are just a cash grab. $13 off brand mouse it is.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.00948773448773451,0.47247763347763355
2,3.0,"UPDATE 4/21/20: Just received a warranty replacement for the mouse. Increased my rating to 3 stars. Still unhappy that the mouse broke so quickly, especially for the price and target use.. I purchased the mouse in May 2019. Beginning in March 2020, the mouse started acting funny. The left mouse button would not work correctly in 2 ways: 1) single clicks were sent as double clicks and vice versa, and 2) click-and-drag stopped working. Instead, it acted as if I released the mouse button mid-movement and then clicked again. This would have the effect of dragging a different item than I originally selected.. Both of these issues affect gaming, but they also affects work, as dragging formulas in Excel or moving e-mails to folders no longer work. Also, trying to select a word or sentence by double-clicking is nearly impossible.. Searching Logitech's forums, this appears to be a known issue, reported by many users.. I have contacted Logitech support, but have not received a reply yet. I will update this review once/if I do. Otherwise, I would warn others to avoid a mouse that stops working correctly after only a few months.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",-0.03177655677655677,0.5434065934065934

4,2.0,"Many years ago Logitech was the go-to brand for computer peripherals but for the last decade my experience with their mice has been quite poor. I have Logitech webcams that after many years are still great, an illuminated keyboard that's lasted a decade and a 5.1 speaker set that's lasted even longer. My first Logitech mouse the 518 similarly lasted many years before the middle mouse button started to fail. Next I replaced it with another one which failed within a year. After that I went to a G400 that within 2 years started to have button fails / produce the double click error. Maybe it's a fluke, got another G400. Failed at about a year. Will try the G502, again not even a whole year before it started failing along with the double click error. 2nd G502 - same result 1 year. This is in a dry, temperature controlled, clean environment with no liquids or foods being spilled on it. I've already gotten the new out of retirement version of the Mx518 but if it produces the same result I'm looking elsewhere for my next mouse.. Update: I tried to return the two mice I had that were within warranty. Logitech wants you to record yourself clicking the mouse over 100 times on a 3rd party site designed to check for double clicks while holding the serial number in the frame. That's just the first step of the potential return process. No more Logitech mice for me. The double click issue is well know enough by Logitech to already have a process in place for you, not them to document it, then they know its a widespread issue and should stop wasting the customers time.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.030823863636363635,0.3027462121212121
5,1.0,"The design and ergonomics of this mouse are outstanding. All the buttons are placed perfectly, the freewheeling ability of the scroll wheel makes traversing long web pages or documents incredibly easy. Even the companion software doesn't give me that much to complain about.. But the Chinese Omron switches Logitech puts in this mouse are terrible, and Logitech knows it.. Within two months of my original purchase, I began experiencing the dreaded double click issue, and quickly opened a ticket with Logitech support. To their credit, they were able to quickly send me a replacement with very little fuss.. Now, less than 10 months of only moderate use later, not only has the left click started to intermittently have the double clicking issue, but the mouse 5 button has failed entirely. I have opened another support ticket, and hope to be able to get yet another replacement, but this is unacceptable. They know these switches are bad. Consumers have had to resort to repairing the switches themselves or even buying the higher quality Japanese made Omron switches to drop in as replacements.. If I do get a SECOND replacement (within only the first year of owning this mouse) I will gladly continue to use it until it too starts to display these issues, but I can't in good conscience recommend this mouse to anyone.

TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use.. I got the G502 HERO as a replacement to my long time favorite mouse the G502 Proteus Core. The decision to upgrade was due to natural wear on the Proteus Core from over years of use along with the desire to have better software support for managing mouse profiles and settings through the newer Logitech G HUB software.. My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured. With the Proteus Core I had been using the Logitech Gaming Software to manage profiles, lights, and configurations but I want to make sure I was using the recommended software with the new HERO mouse. I opted to uninstall the LGS so that I could install G Hub without any worry of problem or conflict between the two pieces of software. When attempting to install G Hub it would get stuck at the ""Downloading and Installing"" part of the installer, and this was after leaving it be for almost an hour. After killing the install process, I scoured my systems for remnants of LGS from AppData folders to Registry entries to make sure I deleted anything that could cause conflict. Upon rebooting I attempted to install G Hub again only to yield the same issue I encountered before all of this taking on Windows 10 Pro 1809 at the time. Since I couldn't get the G Hub software working I figured I would have to reset or reinstall Windows to make sure the software was working with a blank slate, but I was not about to reinstall my whole OS to test that theory just to get my mouse to work so I resorted to reinstalling LGS to get my new HERO mouse configured.. Now that the mouse had been configured to my preferred button layout and DPI setting, I was able to starting using it normally. To make sure everything felt normal I quickly went through a couple of my regular games to verify that my muscle memory was still relevant since the HERO is the exactly same form factor as the Proteus Core. The new mouse was proving to be what I had hoped for, barring the earlier dilemma with the software.. Over the course of April I occasionally had something very strange happen while in use; at random times without predictors or warning my cursor on screen would shoot to one of the corners of my screen and get pinned there. In FPS games this would cause my character to suddenly start staring at the ground or the sky while rapidly spinning in one direction, indicating that the mouse was perceiving continuous horizontal and vertical inputs despite the mouse being stationary. This could only be interrupted by lifting the mouse off of the mousepad, a CORSAIR MM600, and setting it back down, which would stop the constant input and everything would go back to normal. In over 6 years of gaming on PC, 3 of which were with the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I had never encountered any issue like this with any of the Razer or Logitech mice I had used up to that point.. Come mid May the issue had persisted, so I found a day to reinstall Windows 10 to the latest version 1903 in the hopes that finally being able to run the G Hub software would somehow magically fix what I believe to be a sensor issue with the mouse itself. With Windows 10 1903 installed, the G Hub software finally complete its own installation without an issue, but the cursor still continued to randomly get pinned to a corner of the screen without warning.. Since I had confidently ruled out software, I decided to contact Logitech support. After explaining everything to the support agent, they decided that they would send me a new replacement mouse which arrived only a few days later. Within only a couple weeks I experienced the cursor issue again with the replacement HERO mouse from Logitech support, but it seemed to happen less often so I dealt with it.. It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down.. I want to love this mouse, but unless Logitech can improve their QC I cannot recommend them at this time.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.1251643298658224,0.4789567894791774

9,1.0,"When I got the mouse, I figured it would just take some period of adjustment. Well here I am, outside of the return window, still not ""adjusted' to the mouse's shape and size.. The mouse is just too small, I don't have particularly big hands, if anything they're average sized. I cannot find a comfortable grip of this mouse. When I place my hand how it most naturally fits on the mouse, the extra buttons are out of reach. When I put my whole hand on the mouse (so that the top of my palm touches), my fingers extend over the extra buttons so I have to awkwardly press them with my joints.. The profile feature of the mouse is nice, with different sets of DPI adjustments for switching between shooters and casual browsing. The mouse is mechanically nice, the buttons feel good and don't feel cheap, but the shape of the mouse is wrong.. Ultimately what I'm looking for in a mouse is comfort during use and I did not find it here. If you have small hands go for it, otherwise, assess other options.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.07386363636363634,0.5541666666666667

As for the product itself, I use it lightly on a daily basis and yet, I've come across the same issue many others have. Mouse is double clicking on its own, when I mean to single click. Overall, I feel like this mouse is not worth the money at all, I paid less than half for off brand mouse with better quality and longer lifespan (~2 years before being replaced by this one). In a you get what you pay for manner, I understandably replaced my previous chinese offbrand mouse with this new logitech mouse.

1,1.0,"This is the second G502 I bought in my lifetime. I bought this to back up my G903 mouse (that also broke in under 2 years). Now, I bought this G502, because the first one I bought worked really well! It lasted a long while, no issues, and it's what has sold me on keeping on with Logi products. Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled.. What's wrong with this new G502? Plenty.. It just started up, and it's a doozy. The mouse, when sitting still, sends signals to my PC to move my cursor, when... I'm not even... touching the mouse? Not only that, but the mouse seems to disconnect from my pc and reset the DPI to a higher DPI than I'm comfortable with. Basically, the mouse has a spasm and just does its own thing for a little while until it decides to say hello to the pc again.. What was wrong with the G903? Bad, cheap, switches. I did not learn about them until the G903 went kaput. Logi uses cheap switches doomed to fail, fantastic.. After all this, I can't help but to be severely disappointed. I bought this G502 a few days ago, it already has issues. And trust me when I say, you're probably better off biting the bullet and just buying a mouse from a different brand. I certainly don't want to bother trying to get a refund from the stingy corporation that is Logi with cheap switches and horrible customer service.. GG, I got played. It is what it is. Stay away from Logi mice until they decide to actually listen to the hundreds of thousands of people experiencing issues from Logi mice.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.011598124098124104,0.5583694083694083
2,2.0,"This is my 5th g502, the previous 4 all came down with stuttery button issues that everyone has, and trust me they all WILL do this given enough time and use. In the past Logitech made good mice that lasted so long I would wear a hole through the left button before it developed any problems but now I don't even have them last long enough to need teflon tape on the feet, they get the click problem anywhere from 2 to 6 months and need to be replaced.. If there was another mouse that worked as well and fit my hand just right I'd love to stop throwing g502's in the landfill but I haven't found it yet. Buy it on sale and make sure you buy two so you have a spare when the button goes south.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.1208994708994709,0.39312169312169315
3,5.0,"I'd heard people preaching how good the G502 was for quite awhile, but I was hesitant to try it. Maybe it's the aesthetic or the fact that I usually prefer mice with more buttons (I play a lot of MMOs) but I tried a lot of alternatives before I finally decided to give in an try the G502, but boy do I wish I had just done so sooner. After having used the Logitech G Pro mouse for the last year, I decided I was ready to try something different. Don't get me wrong, the Pro is a great mouse, but it's very lightweight which I didn't find terribly comfortable to use (it makes sense in the Pro gamer context, though, so I get it.) The G502 is perfect. It's hefty, and you can customize it using the weights. The button placement is nearly perfect (I find the thumb button a tad hard to reach for my hands) and, like the Pro, the Hero engine is incredibly accurate and satisfying to use. I've ended up using it as my all day mouse, even for work, as it's just so pleasant in the hand. If you're looking for a great mouse at a very reasonable price point, give the G502 a try. (There's also a wireless version available now, but it's considerably more expensive at time of writing.)","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.31143939393939396,0.6608333333333332
4,5.0,"I am writing this after having the mouse a day and a half, so things may change. So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM. My previous older gaming mouse had a few different limitations that really stuck out once I went up to higher resolution and could more consistently hold higher frame rates. Basically at the higher display capabilities my old mouse movements looks rather stuttery and jerky. This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning. So for a run down on how this has improved over an older generation gaming mouse is:. 1. Turned down mouse sensitivity in Windows, Linux, and in games. At the same time turned up DPI resolution on the mouse. The main thing you are really after is turning off ""mouse acceleration"". The difference in smoothness is night and day. I simply did not have the mouse resolution and responsiveness before, at least for first person shooters. With this mouse and a few quick tweaks I do.. 2. Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces. My older gaming mouse just did not have the sensor for this, so it would stick on the mouse pad a little and then the movement would be a little jerky as it transitioned to kinetic friction. This mouse can do it, so problem solved.. 3. This mouse allows balancing with weights. I guesstimated where I thought I needed the weights and so far it is working out pretty nice. The previous gaming mouse had a wireless option with a battery in the back and especially with my big hands not making much contact with the back of the mouse, this would cause things to shift around and not track quite right.. For my recommendations to get the most out of Linux is to:. 1. Setup under Windows. The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate.. 2. In Linux (I am doing this under Ubuntu 18.04, but should work with any distro) first order of business is to disable acceleration. Create the file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf. and enter in the following:. Section ""InputClass"". Identifier ""My Mouse"". Driver ""libinput"". MatchIsPointer ""yes"". Option ""AccelProfile"" ""flat"". Option ""AccelSpeed"" ""0"". EndSection. 3. Restart your X server by logging out and back in.. 4. Make mouse adjustments such as sensitivity levels in X windows and in games and enjoy! The main games to benefit from this are FPS (first person shooter) games. Other games any old mouse will do, but it wasn't those games that pushed you to get this mouse, right?. As a summary, even within a few hours of having this mouse I am finding that I am not getting nauseous as much with FPS gaming, movement looks a lot smoother, and I am quickly getting in a lot more shots and especially a lot more sniping head shots. Even in a window manager doing things like grabbing the edge of a window to move it around is a lot easier now.. While some may debate whether this mouse is as good as another mouse currently on the market, at least going from an older generation gaming mouse to this one is a big improvement. I suppose my only qualm so far is I fired up the utility in Windows to configure it where Linux is my primary OS. Also while some people say DPI does not matter, it seems like it helps when you turn off mouse acceleration and then use higher DPI resolutions to compensate along with a good polling rate. I would consider the result from this mouse once finding the right settings to be ""perfect tracking"".","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.16307349423787776,0.4437040661013264
5,5.0,"First off, 11 programmable buttons + Gshift. If you dont know what Gshift is, its like rolling your hotkeys in MMORPGS. This pairs great with games that demand more marcos with games like BDO, SCUM, and all the other titles that have a bit more commands. I couldn't do this with my Corsair Glaive Pro and tbh, spending $60 then compared to this made me regret everything. The program that comes with this mouse is foreign at first, but in the end, gets simple to use. I have both the Ique (Corsiar keyboard) paired with this mouse and both run great with each other. This app like the ique (program for corsair), can both pair games to profile, so as you launch the game, it switches to that specific profile without you having to change the macros all the time.. I personally dont like the looks, but the utility of this mouse, makes me love the heck out of this. If you are looking for the best under $50 gaming mouse, this has to the the top pick in my opinion. Do yourself a favor when you bu this mouse - learn it, and learn about all the different things you can do it with.

6,3.0,"First off, I'm biased. I've been using the Proteus Core version for 2-3 years. Bought back when they were in the $100 range. Loved the mouse. So naturally its hard not to go for the updated version for $41 since mine is getting ragged. Saw that the special edition was $29 but not digging the black and white scheme. Much rather have the all black and since that was the only difference, I paid the extra $12 for the regular version. Weird.. Honestly I really wanted to go to a the wireless G502 but since its literally a $110 up charge ($41 vs $149) for being cordless, theres no way. Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing. Oh well. I'm happy as every with my new G502 and should be for another 2-3 years I imagine.. **EDIT** 12/25/19. Have to send this back for a replacement. The mouse wheel buttons are defective. If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly). The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch. They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button. Really hoping this is a defect in this particular mouse and not a widespread problem with the new HERO line of the G502. My old G502 has no issue with this whatsoever even after years of hard use.. **EDIT** 12/27/19. First off, big ups to AMAZON for sending me a replacement so quickly! Great customer service. Bad news is it seems the issue I am having wasn't a one off problem. You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously. I hope I am explaining this right. I guess it would be buttons 10 and 11 that depress when you push the mouse wheel left or right. I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well. I've decided to keep the mouse because its still a great everyday driver but for a gaming mouse, I wouldn't recommended it if you like to use the middle mouse click.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.07193512506012506,0.3807271432271433
7,2.0,"I use programmable mice to speed up programming tasks. The programmable buttons on this mouse have weak action and are easy to press by accident. The previous logitech mouse I used for years (sadly no longer available) worked much better. I would be willing to put up with this inferior replacement for its predecessor except after a couple of weeks it started misbehaving. The cursor would start randomly moving. The mouse was sending a continual ""right"" or ""up"" or other signal to the computer. Sometimes the mouse would return to normal use with some vigorous scrolling. Sometimes I would have to disconnect/reconnect the USB to get it to work again. The final straw was when I accidentally deleted a document when the mouse decided to move just as I was clicking.. I looked around the internet and apparently this has been a common problem for years that Logitech cannot be bothered to fix. I tried seven ""solutions"" to the problem including new drivers, new firmware, and turning off power saving features. Nothing worked.. I was also sad to see the Logitech, after all these years, is still using the most counter-intuitive app to program the mouse I have ever seen.

I believe they have the same tech on the inside but just fewer bells and whistles. I own both and they are both fantastic.. Edit to review:. After just a few months, both right and left mouse clickers are malfunctioning. The left one double clicks almost every time I click it (already attempted several ""fixes"" but it appears to be the hardware as nothing the all knowing google has to suggest has worked) and the left one will not maintain a click when I hold it down (for games such as Call of Duty this is detrimental as I am unable to maintain a zoom in with scopes).. Because of this, I am lowering my 5-star review to 2 stars. This should happen. I would expect this type of issue from some off brand Chinese sweat-shop mouse.

Seriously, just do a quick Google search and you'll see a LOT of complaints about it.. It took all day to figure it out and create new profiles and make it recognize games. No help could be found on the Logitech site and Google offered little help.. Eventually I was able to make everything work as I wanted but it was a frustrating day..

Corsair has constantly let me down with going through over 9 mice in just under three years between two people on several rigs. Razer is usually overpriced and doesn't feel that great. Logitech comes in clutch.. This thing is built like a tank. It's heavy. It's solid. It has tons of program options, and the software is a joy to work with. The RGB LEDs are fully programable. The cable feels pretty solid. It's accurate. The control of the mouse is great. Three clickers is the new norm. Getting used to it takes about two to three days, but when you do, its like wow, why didn't we normalize this sooner.. I play league and wow, genshin impact, stardew valley, and almost any survival horror game that comes out. Works great for everything. As well I use this in my recording studio as my macro mighty mouse. Keybinding things on the go for quick and easy access. Again, works great. 10/10. This is far superiors to any other mmo mouse out IMO.. My only gripe is because its so big, and if you have little hands, you might get some wrist, hand cramps. If I game for 10+ hours it really starts to become an issue. So take that for what you will. This isn't just the logitech, all big mice do it. Just know that its fat and thiccc, and feels amazing.

2,4.0,"Pros:. Solid sensor, good programmable button options, software worked well on Windows 10 and Mac OSX.. Wired, so no dealing with batteries, chargers, connections, or lag. The rubber on the side grips feels good.. Settings can be saved to onboard memory, so the color and speed and button tweaks work on any machine, not just ones with the driver and your profile installed, unlike Razor.. Cons:. Feels light/cheap even with the added weights, like every piece of plastic was as thin as they could make it without it shattering during shipping.. The scroll wheel wobbles just slightly left and right (it is supposed to move left right when pushed, but I mean just by moving the mouse on the desk, the wheel flops a 1/2 millimeter back and forth, causing a distracting rattle. It does it less when you turn off freewheel and use clicky wheel, but it's still audible there, too.. Some settings don't seem to be editable in onboard memory, you have to download the profile, update it there, then re-upload it. Wouldn't be a big deal, but you can't even view the button customizations without downloading, it just tells you how many buttons were programmed, not what they do.. Not built for large hands - feels 80% of normal size. For example my thumb can't rest in the thumb slot below the two side buttons; with my thumb resting against the bottom of the groove, the top of my thumb is still against the two top buttons, not nestled into the recess below them.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.1739145658263305,0.391421568627451
3,2.0,"Bought it thinking I was getting a good deal since it was on sale for $40 at the time of purchase. As it would be a good replacement after the micro switches in my G9x died. The profile is bit high and it kind of hurts my index finger, its as if my index and middle fingers are slightly extended. I'm not sure if I have a defective product but the mouse wheel is off balanced. If you slowly move the mouse wheel up in increments (as if you're browsing a webpage), the wheel will slightly rock backwards. At first I thought it was some kind of issue with the scroll bar in my browser, spent a good evening trying to locate a bug in Chrome that didn't exist, and it was the mouse wheel the entire time. Looked up the issue online and apparently this is a common production flaw with the G502 series. The only real fix is to buy a replacement mouse wheel but for G500/G500s and swap it in. If you're shopping around for a Logitech mouse, please try and avoid any mice with this mouse wheel type.. Furthermore, having to use G Hub to program the mouse is an absolute nightmare of an experience, honestly I think I hated having to use that software than the issue with the mouse wheel.

Removable weights allow you to customize how hefty it is in hand. I added all the weights and enjoy it being a heavier mouse.. DPI settings are great. Really let's you set your sensitivity level and quickly make changes to it based on what you're doing.. Customizable lighting. You will need to download the app, but you can change the lighting to what color you want and also how it lights up or reacts to sound.. Ergonomics. This mouse feels great in the hand. I have large hands and it still feels great to me. The grips and textures compliment your hand quite well and I've not had any issues with it.. Cons:. DPI buttons are a little too close to the left mouse button. This has caused me to inadvertently change DPI settings a few times. It's easy and fast to switch back, but can be annoying.. Width. As noted, I have large hands. So this may only apply to others like me. I feel this mouse could be wider for a better fill of my hand. However, it might be too much for others with smaller hands..

In other words, you'd click and hold the left mouse button to drag something, but the mouse would let off the hold even though you were still holding the left mouse button down. This makes any task that involves dragging and dropping (or drawing something by holding the left mouse button) infuriating if not impossible. After reading around, it sounds like it's a known hardware issue with this mouse. Unfortunately, Logitech's support answer is to try spraying compressed air in the mouse to clear any debris - this did not work. I submitted a support request to Logitech and haven't heard back in a week. I certainly won't buy another G502 to replace this one, and I'll have to consider other brands based on this experience.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",-0.003049289891395157,0.39111319966583125
6,1.0,"Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones.. The BAD:. This mouse doesn‚Äôt glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place. Issue here is the new and NOT improved weight system. Unlike the old push-of-a-button slide out tray on G500, the boomerang shaped weights need to be wedged into the bottom of the mouse once you pop the side corner and peel off the underside. (By the way, this is completely counter intuitive and not mentioned in the tiny sheet of a paper that passes for a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù. Instead you are supposed to find an official YouTube video by Logitech describing the procedure. What?! What happened with the button-push system?) The entire door is held, barely at that, by a super weak 1g magnet and two tiny plastic latches that seem like a major part endurance oversight. (No way they won‚Äôt break at some point in the future).. As reported on reddit and elsewhere, the mouse underside weights compartment door does not close all the way. There is some give and it makes the mouse uneven on the bottom. That said, even removing the weights AND the door entirely, the mouse will still scratch and grate since the mouse feet elsewhere were positioned unevenly ( There are no feet positioned on right side at all for example, which makes the mouse uneven door-issue-aside.). All of this can be mitigated by not using the G502 on a hard surface like wood, glass, or those new ‚Äúpro-gamer‚Äù plastic or metal pads. But even on a cloth mat after a few hours there were tracks and tiny rips in the cloth material. Wow, Logitech!? How the mighty have fallen!. Another issue is plastic. Cheap plastic everywhere that is. Nowadays even never-heard-of-brands making ‚ÄúCool Gamer RGB overload‚Äù mice for $10-$15 come with rubberized coating. Other than the side grips, the entirety of G502 is cheap slick plastic which will make the mouse slide around‚Ä¶ well, grind around let‚Äôs be honest. Also, it has been shrunken in all possible dimensions compared to G500. It is narrower, shorter and much lower than the G500. Seems like something designed for your average teenage/tween hand, which I‚Äôm sure is the target demographic now anyway.. All in all, all of the above can explained by down-costing. This mouse (G502) screams ‚Äúcut-costs‚Äù, for the manufacturer that is. You, the user, are still expected to pay 2 to 2.5 times as much as you did for the G5 or G500 10-15 years ago while getting something much inferior. Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions. (The underside of the mouse does not shut clean making the bottom of the mouse uneven? How was this overlooked?! And then made by the million?). The GOOD:. The sensor is top notch. While not majorly improved, the increase in precision is noticeable and measurable vs G500 for instance. Jitter is lower and bizarre acceleration issues seem to be non-existent on G502. Cord is pretty nice. Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality. Something easily frayed G500 cord could have used. Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English.. Summary:. Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse. 10 years ago this would have been a‚Ä¶ well, still a downgrade to a G500, but not many options were as available back then, so it might have been an option of some kind. Now, even no-name ‚ÄúGamer-Cool‚Äù brands come with decent enough software, (macros, RGB configurability, profiles, DPI tweaking and all), rubberized coating, latest Pixart sensors, weight systems, you name it, all for under $20, sometimes even for under $15. It seems the no-names have gotten a bit better, if not a whole lot better and name brands like Logitech have gotten a bit worse and down-costed to the absolute maximum, so now everything sits in the middle and luck-of-the-draw is what rules the day and the mouse pad.. I would say G502 is on par with your average random $15 no-name brand ‚ÄúGamer-Cool‚Äù mouse on Amazon, but even those have rubberized coating, proper height and size for a grown man‚Äôs hand, and actual metal feet. How the mighty have fallen...","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.06798404339562876,0.5099434237848871
7,2.0,"I am so very disappointed with this mouse, so-called one of the best gamer mouse at the moment. I couldn't stand using it for more than an hour, and had to switch back to my cheap, 6-year-old, discontinued, MSI Interceptor DS200. I wish I've done more research before buying and did not get carried away with the gamer community reviews.. There are two main reasons for me not liking this mouse: the wheel (which is poorly designed in many ways) and the Logitech software.. In almost every other aspect the mouse is very good. It looks great, very comfortable for the hand, and the thumb button setup is just perfect.. THE WHEEL, OMG THE WHEEL.... How a little part can be so flawed to totally ruin the experience? The very first thing you will notice when you unbox the mouse is that the wheel is released and will spin freely. After freaking out for a second you will also notice that there is a button that will lock the wheel allowing for the use we all like and need.. However, there are three problems with the locked wheel: The first is that it is extremely noisy, more than you can imagine. The second is that it does not scroll easily, the movement is not smooth at all. And the third is that the wheel is made of metal, which causes your finger to slide occasionally (when the wheel is locked) and miss a few scrolls, which is a big flaw.. And finally, there is the rattling sound. As soon as you start moving the mouse with moderate speed you will feel like something is loose in the inside. It is the wheel, again, moving from side to side, clashing against the plastic, and this is very, very annoying. There are some YouTube tutorials that teach you how to stick a tape on the side to prevent the rattling. Although I'm not into cheap hacks to my new hardware I was about to accept all these flaws and try to get used to them as soon as possible. But then I met the Logitech software problem.... LOGITECH VS LOGITECH. I have a Logitech G910 keyboard which I love and I have been using for quite some time, along with the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS). The LGS is supposed to detect your Logitech hardware and let you configure all of them from one place. However, despite my efforts LGS never detected my G502 mouse.. That left me no choice but to download and install G-Hub, a newer Logitech software that is supposed to be better than LGS. But it's not, It's actually much worse, although it did detect my keyboard and my mouse.. G-Hub is poorly designed, it is bugged and it is missing many cool features that LGS had, making a hassle out of the simpler tasks like coloring your keyboard for a specific game, or keeping a custom default DPI for the mouse. Also, the import feature for your LGS profiles is just broken. G-Hub wont import anything and you will lose all your LGS customizations and macros.. Ok, I thought: maybe I can use G-Hub for the mouse and LGS for the keyboard. Nope, Logitech wont let you use both, and as soon as you install G-Hub it will block LGS.. I was not keen to ruin my experience with the G-910 in order to use a flawed mouse, so I decided I will not use the G502 for now.. I live outside of the US and getting a refund is not an option. Besides, the mouse is not broken, it's just flawed by design.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.0952418944691672,0.49431108285653735
8,5.0,"(BACKSTORY). I actually owned this mouse before, the only difference is that I purchased it from a different vendor (Gamestop) and during the same day I was already having an issue with my right click button being ""sticky"", and after some time I had issues with the left switch staying pressed and was even causing double-click issues.. I attempted to fix this problem by ordering some new switches as a replacement, unfortunately de-soldering the switches themselves proved to be a very time-consuming since no matter how much solder I was able to remove using both the solder pen and the solder wick, the old switches would just not let go.. After using some (unfortunate) force I was able to pry the left switch out, but I was worried I had to go through a brutish process just to do so before I was able to finally solder the new switch in place.. Upon putting everything back together I was however already met with some bad news, not only did the LED for the product logo stop function, but so did my scroll wheel, I attempted to fix the latter issue myself but have achieved no success, but at the very least the new button was working fine until I was able to get a new copy shipped in (7/31/2021).. (END OF BACKSTORY). As of this review date's submission I have not be getting any issues with the mouse, and while the Logitech app reads it to be the model with a 25k sensor it's odd that the (abused) box it came in (with no packaging either besides the box itself) advertises it as the 16k model.. But overall, and for the time being, the mouse is working great and I even applied some rubber anti-sweat adhesive layers over it which helps me protect the aesthetic quality of the mouse, and even though I thoroughly wash my hands before settling myself back to my computer I still prefer the mouse with the rubber covers concealing the plastic matte finish.. Now to run my favorite source games and bind some certain commands to my scroll wheel.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.08398395721925135,0.4599115100585689
9,3.0,"As an entry level gaming mouse it's decent. I've tried maybe 5 different brands, my favorite being the Mad Catz. I switched to Logitech over others like Corsair due to the size and the features. I have large hands and I claw grip my mouse. Logitech fits my hand better. It's cheap, however.. Two have failed on me in under a year. In both cases the scroll wheel. And in the second case the left mouse button. I'll be going back to Mad Catz now that they fixed their quality issues. But I'm not complaining, Logitech is decent, cheap - and replaceable.. One comment on the G HUB software. I think it's over complicated for mouse only. Others' may be better or worse, I don't know. I don't tend to save macros or do any custom programming. I prefer to just change dpi and the LED. And it's designed a suite so it's overkill for one piece of hardware I think and I'd rather just do without it.","Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, HERO 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC / Mac",0.008630952380952378,0.5618452380952381

The only reason I choose this card at the time was that it was on sale for only $3 more. I also get the awesome design along with 4x the storage space.. For those wondering why the free space on the card read 119, it is because of the way gigabytes are calculated.. The package has 1gb equaling 1,000,000,000 bytes. Really 1gb is 1,073,741,824 bytes.

I have none of my Nintendo files saved to the card and it indicates nothing is stored on it but clearly shows less storage than advertised..

I‚Äôm also not sure why it saves things to the SD card when there is available space on the Switch.

The storage capacity is great, my system is the 32gb model, and it really lets me have multiple games installed.. its great for long gaming sessions when you are dedicated to 1 game at a time, the card itself has longer loading times, and some games can crash while on the SD card, this is obviously bad, and is probably a result of the ""capacity vs data access rate"". but it is quick enough to transfer the games back and forth between the console and the SD card. i transfer the game while i get a drink and go pee and get my gaming setup ready for the next 3 hours of grinding.. As far as value for the money, it is a great card! there are other high speed cards with equal or greater QC for cheaper prices that are not ""officially licensed"", if you want the brand you pay the price!. i reccomend buying the game cartridges (resale value, plus faster load times) but not every game is available in a cartridge..

5,5.0,"This little card is a somewhat frivolous additional cost considering you will never see the card once you put it in your Switch. However, the joy of seeing the themed card sort of makes up for the additional cost you pay. That is not to say that this is purely cosmetic in its fiction though. Let me explain.. This card was customized to run on the Nintendo Switch. (According to other sources I read) so when you buy this, you know that performance will have not only been considered, but be able to execute the task at hand... namely, playing some sweet Switch video game action! I can verify this personally as I have never had issues with my card since purchasing it. It‚Äôs also very fast in its read speed. It is not the fastest on the market, but that does not necessarily mean it is sub par. The extra speed from other cards may not be necessary in all honesty, so that could be overkill. Again, it works flawlessly when in everyday gaming, and that is the important thing when purchasing a video memory extension.. In summary, this is not the cheapest, nor the fastest card on the market. But at the end of the day, it looks great, and it works without any issues.

After extensive googling for solutions, there were mentions of fake SD cards on Amazon, so I took a closer look at the packaging that I barely glanced at in my excitement. It definitely seems fake since the seal between the two cardboard pieces indented on places where text was printed on, and there is color clipping on the edge of the package where there shouldn't be any...

One of the reasons I purchased the card was so I could transfer downloaded games and data to another switch while mine is getting repaired for joycon connection issues.... Upon doing some research there is apparently a way if you have a PC you can transfer data to the PC reformat the card to the new switch then putting the data back on from the PC manually.

Be safe and just get this brand that you trust for your gadget, even if this just has a mushroom and a nintendo logo on it, it is worth it.

We usually play it in the past at a vintage arcade. This also made my son realize we could do this on raspberry pi. One negative thing is the cord for the controller is short.

The funny thing is though that the box is bigger than expected for a console of this size and heavier with the amount of protective boxes on the inside.

The Amazon virtual gaming codes don't work like that. There are a few steps to redeem the code from the purchaser's Amazon account into the recipient's Roblox account. The PURCHASER has to log into THEIR OWN Amazon account first and access the code from there.. So...step by step, here's what I did:. ***Use EITHER A) or B) below to first get to your Games and Software Library in your Amazon account.. A) *I went back to the email I had received and clicked on the button in MY email that says ""Your Games and Software Library"". Or...alternately,. B) You can log into your Amazon account. > click in the upper Right on the banner where it says ""Account and Lists"" to get to ""YOUR ACCOUNT"" page.. >>From there you'll see a section titled: ""Digital content and devices"". >>> in that section you'll see a link that says: ""Digital games and software"" (click that link) ]. *This takes you to the ""Games and Software Library"" in the PURCHASER'S (YOUR) Amazon account first.. Here is where you'll be able to see the Gift Card that you purchased.. *Next to the picture of the game card, Right above the Pin Code, you'll see a link that says: ""How to Redeem This Item"" (click that link). * An instruction box pops up.. *In that instruction box: click on the link in step 2 that says. ""Go to the Game Card Redemption Page"". *This brings you to a Roblox account login page.. *IMPORTANT** Here is where you now have to log into THE RECIPIENT'S Roblox account. (In my case, MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S account. She had to tell me her user name and password). *Since I was using my computer, HER ACCOUNT didn't recognize it, so it also will either text or email a 6 digit security-code to the owner of the Roblox account. It texted the code to my granddaughter's cell phone, and she texted it to me. I had to type it in, in order to get into HER account.. *NOW I was in her Roblux account and at the point where I was able to type in the redemption key code and redeem it. She then texted me back saying it worked!!. I had seen several reviews where people complained that these didn't work and they thought they couldn't be redeemed. I""m hoping it's helpful for the steps to be explained in detail.",Roblox Gift Card - 800 Robux [Includes Exclusive Virtual Item] [Online Game Code],0.06970443349753694,0.4330049261083744

DO NOT BELIEVE THE 1 STAR REVIEWS!! My kids ordered the cards in the middle of the night, my email immediately sounded with the confirmation of purchase that Amazon sends out quickly followed by the electronic gift card email with the code. My 10 yr old followed step by step the instructions on the card to redeem the electronic card. From the time that I told my kids they could buy the item (1 at first) to the time they were using the Robux in their accounts on their phone was less than 5 minutes.

9,5.0,"Head's up...if you need a physical gift card, this is NOT what you are looking for. This is digital only - Amazon sends you the code. If purchasing for someone else as a gift, you could easily print the code or copy it in an email to them...but no physical card is ever sent.. I was slightly wary about purchasing this online code since there are some negative reviews stating that the Robux were never received by some users, but we have purchased the digital code twice now and have had no issues. It seems to come instantly with no waiting. As soon as I make the purchase, Amazon emails me a confirmation code. In the email, there is a link that they ask you to click that takes you to your digital code ""library"". Once you click it (I did so using my Android phone) you will see the item as the top item on your recent purchases. That is the code you will need to enter on Roblox in the ""redeem gift card"" area.. We actually bought the code as a gift for my daughter's friend, I emailed her mother the code after I copied it from my ""library"".

9,5.0,"....Updated Review..... I am updating my previous 2-star review to 5 stars because we finally did receive a code for the exclusive dance. However, it‚Äôs important to note this purchase does not explain how these exclusive items will arrive and that‚Äôs confusing, especially if it's a gift. The backpack auto loads once the gift card is redeemed. The chicken dance arrives via email to the Amazon customer several days later and is code that must be used when logged into a desktop (not iPad or xBox), as does the gift card.. Previous Review: Unfortunately this only gave the 2000 Robux and the Red Robux Backack (not really desired). It did not add the exclusive Chicken Dance to my child's inventory, which was the purpose of purchasing this way. We could have spent $25 directly on Roblox and received more Robux (2200). Instead we have fewer Robux and a disappointed kid. (The Robux Gift Card was purchased and redeemed prior to April 30th expiration, so this is not the reason for the missing dance animation.)",Roblox Gift Card - 800 Robux [Includes Exclusive Virtual Item] [Online Game Code],-0.12416666666666668,0.48166666666666674

I called customer service and they relayed that with the third party seller, we would have to wait 4 hours to try the code to see if it works. So it isn't an instant redeem as it has been in the past. Also, on the Roblox website you can buy the same amount for $20 rather than pay the extra $5. We love using Amazon as a safe place for these purchases and the extra money insures we get what we paid for without any funny business of using our credit card elsewhere. This time was not a good purchase as my little is now in tears about earning robux money (past experience of immediate access/use of Amazon purchased codes and that expectation in mind) and she cannot have it until the middle of the night.

5,5.0,"Works great. I had many years playing ROBLOX so I trust them. I would definitely buy this again without hesitation. One thing before you do the tips/directions, When you buy the card, a screen comes up saying ""Thank you, your order has been placed."" There should be a ""Review your digital items"" button and what you want to do is press on that button, then it will bring you to the products details. The pin code should be there. Copy it, and follow the tips provided below.. TIPS ON HOW TO REDEEM THE CARD (Computer/Laptop/PC):. - Go to ""Home - Roblox"" or just the Home part of roblox.. - Press on the icon showing three horizontal lines on the top left of your screen.. - Press on the ""Gift Cards"" button which is right on the top of the ""Get Premium"" icon.. - Press on the ""Redeem Card"" button on the right top of the web.. - Finally, paste the pin code in the text section or type it down.. If you need extra help on redeeming the robux or you are just stuck, then watch a video on how to do it. Remember to put the type of device at the end of your sentence. For example, if your using a phone, you should write, ""How to redeem a amazon digital roblox robux card on roblox mobile"" so that you get the similar directions. Hope you guys found this helpful, I genuinely think the people who give something less then 4 stars are just liars, trolls, or haters so do not listen to them.

6,3.0,"So this was very frustrating to redeem. I've spent the last 30 minutes trying to do it, but finally got it to work.. So first I logged into my daughters account from my computer. I clicked the three lines on the left and went down to ""Gift Cards"" and then clicked ""Redeem Card"" This popped up an area to enter the PIN code that Amazon sends you via email and that is stored in your digital items in your 'Game Library'. Roblox wanted me to verify that I was a human and had me click arrows to roll a ball until animals were upright. I spent about 15 minutes doing this and every single time it told me that one them was incorrect and it would not redeem the card. Talk about frustrating!!!. I then tried to redeem it through the app on my phone but it will not let you. It says you have to do it from a browser.. Finally, I used my phone browser and typed in roblox.com/redeem. I then logged into Roblox using my daughters account info. I was able to type in the PIN code and it again wanted to verify I was a human. It did not have the animal ball thing though. This verification was much easier as it was shadows and I had to pick the shape that was correct. I was finally able to verify I was a human and it redeemed the card. It does not redeem for a credit, it is only for 800 Robux.. The downside is right now Roblox has $9.99 for 880 Robux. So spending $10 for this gift card worth only 800 Robux is not worth it. I suggest you just go to Roblox and buy it through them than through Amazon. My daughter used her allowance money to buy it, but now I know if she wants to again we should buy it through Roblox and NOT Amazon.

Update 2 (Apr-19-2020): Started having problems with LT, turns out there are pads on the triggers themselves to be more padded and to have softer bottom out and return, and the glue happened to leak out and stick, made the trigger feel scratchy and sticky at the very top of the travel. So if there's ever something wrong with your elite triggers (since i haven't seen these on regular controllers) check to see if there's any adhesive leaking from the pads or anything on the PCB1.

I purchased this new series ‚Äúseries 2‚Äù and when it arrived I immediately opened it up and started to just do a quick check to make sure there were no problems with the controller‚Äôs functionality. Everything felt EXTREMELY AMAZING and I was so happy with the controller! But, 5 seconds later I was no longer happy and I was very upset! The reason for this was because after I pushed the A button it just stuck down into the controller?!. It doesn‚Äôt do like a quick stick then pop out, I mean it literally stays completely down?!! In order to get the A button back into its normal position I have to use a very tiny flathead screwdriver to pry it out! The B button sticks pretty bad as well but not like the A button does!.

0,1.0,"UPDATE 3/15/19: I took a hiatus from gaming since November. Literally used this for maybe 5 or so hours. The left analog stick broke. It doesn't click down. Really disappointed. Thankfully I'm like a week away from my warranty. So I have to send it back. Now I'm going to have to use my original Elite controller for the time being that is over 4 years old! It's pathetic that my elite one controller still works and this one breaks.. Original review: I have been using the first elite controller for nearly the last 4 years. It still works, but it's not without it's issues about quality.. This series 2 controller has some similarities with the first edition. But there are differences as well.. 1. Internal battery and case charging. Microsoft was late to the party with putting a internal rechargeable battery in a controller. And it should be a standard across all of their controllers. But it's better than using the play and charge kit. Supposedly the battery can last up to 40 hours according to microsoft.. You can also use the case as a charging dock. But you have the option to charge via the controller as well.. 2. Quality and feel. The feel of the controller is better than the first. Textures grips on the triggers and where you hold it feels more comfortable for a better gaming experience. Especially when you have longer sessions.. 3. Peripherals. This controller comes with the following. 1. 3 sets of analog sticks. 2. 2 D pads.. 3. 2 sets of paddles. 4. Charging case. 5. Braided USB charging cable (USB C). This controller is very flexible. The parts are very easy to swap. I would reccomend experiencing with what configuration works best for you.. 4. Price point. The price is a little steep. And it's $30 more than the series one when that came out. Unfortunately I have to dock a star off for that. While there are improvements, that should be expected more than 4 years later. And you shouldn't have to pay that premium for improvements 4 years later.. More importantly, While the improvements are nice over the first edition, I don't know if it's worth it when you can find the first one at solid prices these days.. 5. Connectivity and functionality. If you are a PC gamer and have a bluetooth card, say goodbye to using a wire or having to buy that Xbox USB wireless adapter that sticks out of the USB port. This controller has internal bluetooth..

6,5.0,"This is my first premium quality gaming controller that I've ever bought so I can't compare it to the Xbox elite series 1 or Scuff controllers. The major advantage of these controllers for me is that I don't have to take my right thumb off of the joystick (which is used for aiming in most games) to press any of the other buttons. This comes into play if you need to jump and aim or crouch and aim at the same time. It sounds silly but those few milliseconds can make a difference if you're big on FPS games. I've been wanting to buy one for a while but read all about quality control issues with the elite series 1, so I figured I'd wait on this version and hope they were fixed. So far I've been extremely impressed with just about every aspect of this controller.. Pros:. -Extremely simple and easy to set up button mapping. It allows for you to assign any button to the four paddles on the back of the controller. -Ergonomics: Feel is just like a regular xbox controller except that it generally feels more substantial and there are 4 paddles on the back. They are positioned so that they are easy to press. -Customization: It comes with a bunch of different thumbsticks you can put on so you can decide what works best for you. I like that you can adjust the tension of the thumbsticks. I did what another reviewer recommended and increased tension then jacked up the sensitivity on my game. This allows me to still move precisely when I need to but also look around much more quickly if I want.. -Hair triggers: The triggers have customizable stops put in so you can designate both the left and right triggers as a long pull, medium pull or short pull (hair trigger). For the hair trigger I only have to pull it very slightly to shoot which helps speed up my reaction time a bit. -Battery: I've only played about 20 hours so far but the battery was still at above 50%. Easily chargeable with your xbox. Cons:. -Can't set up hotkeys (i.e. can't make a single press of a paddle be a double click of a different button). -Heavy, it is much heavier than a regular xbox controller due in part to the internal battery. It doesn't both me but if that is important to you then this might not be the controller for you. -Internal battery: This is a pro and con. The battery life has been great so far but it will inevitably diminish and can't be replaced.. This is where I am at after about 20 hours of playing with this thing. I'll update a few months down the road or sooner if any issues arise",Elite Series 2 Controller - Black,0.11811002178649237,0.45756063109004297
7,1.0,"Got this for PC gaming. Love, LOVE the look and feel. Buttons feel nice and the meaty weight of it just feels right.. But for a premium-priced controller, the lack of responsiveness from the face buttons is completely unacceptable. You expect a controller that works every time at bare minimum and the extra hundred bucks and change would go towards how freaking gorgeous it is. However, when I play an RPG, I let my thumb stretch out over both the X and A buttons and gently squish the A button with the middle joint of my thumb.. Presses register roughly 70% of the time. If my thumb is at a certain angle, I can tap and the audible click and tactile bump happens, but the press does not register on my games or the XBox Accessories app. See video as I slightly adjust my thumb position and the controller just DOES NOT REGISTER. This has never been a problem with any controller I have ever owned, let alone one I spent $200 on. A quick search online shows I am far from alone. I am returning it until MS can sort this out.. UPDATE 6/26/2020: I am exchanging a THIRD controller. They all have this issue--pull the button to the bottom left like it's a control stick. Press A. Nothing happens. Fortunately they seem to know it's a widespread issue so they are generous about replacements.

Got a replacement from amazon so 2nd controller came and this one had an issue where the A button would get stuck and you‚Äôd have to try and wiggle it out.. I do not recommend this controller because it has issues right out of the box. My confidence for this controller is gone. I‚Äôd wait and see how Microsoft responds because at this point, this is an expensive risk to take.. I‚Äôd somewhat recommend the wolverine tournament controller. I had the Wolverine ultimate and what I like most is that it had amazing X, A, B and Y buttons. They click when you press them. My only complaints are after a few months the left stick click/pressing down on it for running in most games stop being as responsive so you had to press it a few and if you play games like for honor and you have to press the right bumper and trigger at the same time, it takes a lot of finesse to actually achieve the button press simultaneously. So to reiterate, get the tournament, not the ultimate unless you absolutely need the headphone adapter on it but even then I don‚Äôt recommend since the extra mapable buttons on the back are kinda hard to reach and very impractical with the button style they went with. I think the tournament has less buttons but they are easier to reach. Anyways, best of luck.",Elite Series 2 Controller - Black,0.07394179894179892,0.40017636684303354

3,2.0,"UPDATED: 1/2/2020. So trying to keep this as short as possible, I have owned 4 Original Elite Controllers - 2 of them replaced under warranty - So lets call that 6 Original Elite controllers. 2 of them I had to scrap for parts as they were out of warranty and become part of my parts supply to keep the others going. Other than the know issues I still liked those controllers.. Now lets move on to the Elite 2 - I have now owned 2 of them about to be 3 as I have seen the following:. First Purchased Elite 2 - Buttons sticking - A and sometimes B - But worse are the BT disconnects that seem to happen when the unit is plugged in and charging. (Clearly an issue as there is no removable battery). Note: I hate the grip material its way too slippery when compared to the original elite. I wish I could fix that in some way. It does not look like it will support aftermarket grips but maybe that would solve it. At least for me my hands physically hurt after playing for a few hours due to needing to grip the controller way harder than I had been used too. So that is a strange side effect I have found.. **Two side notes, I think shipping it with vibration on for a controller that has no removable battery might be taxing the reported play hours per charge, also somewhere needs to be talked about if you use a chatpad and how might power that also can draw**. So in trying to return the first elite to amazon they sent me a new unit for the swap - This unit at first would not pair with the console. I have seen these issues before on controllers in general, but got that working and it needed the normal update to firmware. This was done and no issues. Re-booted everything and all was working. Went to install my chatpad and nothing, it will not show up on the accessories app, it will not light up, it does nothing. Re-attached it to my other elite 2 before I ship it back for credit and it works fine?. So I guess I am very concerned at the reliability of these quite expensive controllers. I have heard rumor that MS is working on this, possibly a software update etc. It is very strange how it reacts when attached to power for charging, and the buttons sticking is clearly a not great issue. I have heard rumors about stick drift issues persisting but I have not seen those personally.. I guess I am checking to see how wide spread this might be and also to make sure that what I am experiencing is possibly Alpha Ring related for the software or possibly Firmware issues, as clearly the ring does not effect the buttons sticking etc I assume that is simply a hardware issue.. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. I have been looking forward to this controller since the 6 I have bought in the last few years all have failed in different ways. Grips falling off. Control stick drift and upper button failures due to non robust design.. So far in using this controller I have found a couple undesirable issues and some nice redesigned items but right now the undesirable ones are bad enough to make the use experience less than fantastic.. #1 is the new grip material is in one word slippery as ice and is actually so slippery that it is causing my hands to go numb as you need to hold onto the controller much harder due to the slippery grips. I put aftermarket grips on my original elites and they worked and felt great.. #2 is the upper vibration motors are loud to the point of annoying and honestly just do not give the high quality feel I would expect for the very expensive price of this controller. I have just turned them off but the lower motors seems to sound and feel better much like the older version.. I have not had it long enough to determine if the integrated battery is going to hold up or if the other redesigned items last for any long term but as a user that has been through many controllers and rebuilt several elite controllers I can only hope those items are actually fixed.

4,2.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I had the Xbox Elite Series 1 controller. It was my favorite gaming controller I had ever used for about 2 years, until the day the piece of plastic that anchors the left bumper to the central hub of the controller broke. After doing some research online, it seems that was a common issue for people. Rather than buy a replacement or try to repair it myself, I went back to my standard controller, as rumors of the Elite Series 2 had started floating around, so I figured I'd grab one when they came out.. I finally got myself the Elite Series 2 two months ago (end of May). I love this controller, much like I loved the Series 1. I wanted it to last. But in the last week, both of the slides for the trigger locks have broken. More specifically, the ""nub""/""tab"" (not sure what to call it) that you use to slide up and down to the different lock levels, has snapped on both sides. I've included pictures here, though it's a little difficult to capture (and my camera was finicky with focusing in on them). There is still about half of the ""nub""/""tab"" left on either side - enough that if I use my finger nail I can catch it and slide it still (we'll see if the rest eventually breaks off?). Occasionally during play my fingers will brush by them now and feel the sharp edge where they snapped, or the sharp point at the end (previously rounded off).. Let me say that I rarely used the trigger locks on the Series 1, and with the Series 2 I had move the right trigger lock to the lowest level early on and left it there, and not touched either lock since (i.e. never used the left trigger lock). This would be an issue for anyone I'd think, especially if you used the trigger locks or adjusted their levels frequently. However, it's especially baffling to me because I basically never touch them. My fingers don't rest on them during normal play. I am the only person in the house who uses/touches the controller. I'm very careful/gentle with it, I don't feel that I particularly put a lot of wear and tear on my accessories. I still have my Xbox One Day One edition controller that is in great condition. Last night after finishing up a play session, I unplugged my headset and went to charge the controller for the night, and as I leaned in toward the charger I heard a piece clatter to the table - the left trigger lock nub (the right one broke off in similar fashion about a week ago). I hadn't used or touched the trigger locks all night, and in fact had never used the left one.. Admittedly this doesn't prevent me from using the controller, because as I've laid out I almost never adjust the trigger locks, and there is still a shard of the tab left that allows me to move them if I need to. Still. Microsoft is charging nearly $200 for this controller. It's supposed to be made out of premium parts/materials. It comes with a very limited warranty (I believe 3 months?). Going through their support only allows you to chat with a bot if you choose accessory support, and your only option is to send the controller off to a depot for repair. This review isn't specifically about Microsoft's warranty coverage or support options, but I feel like people should be aware of the full picture if these controllers are going to start falling apart in under two months, when gently used. I haven't knocked it all the way to 1 star because prior to the trigger locks breaking, I loved the controller. It feels premium. It's comfortable, it's weighty in a good way, the carrying case with built in charging dock is awesome, there are plenty of swappable accessory options, etc. But it's hard to recommend when you may not have long to enjoy all of the good bits before it falls apart.",Elite Series 2 Controller - Black,0.11110135310954984,0.46915170439760606

The fatal problem, for me at least, is that I purchased this for the same reason I purchased the series one: I have large hands, and the long thumb-sticks are much more comfortable for me. Using the short thumb-sticks makes my hands cramp after a while. And this controller only comes with one (1) long thumb-stick, instead of two(2) like the series 1. I am shocked and upset, this thing is priced ridiculously and it fails its primary purpose. Why the one long stick? Is that for the swarms of people with asymmetrical hands?.

7,1.0,"I've preordered two of these, both had problems with the A button not always registering.. I decided to use one of the controllers for a few days, hoping the A button responsiveness would improve with use. It didn't. More so, during this short period of use, it developed a creaking sound in the right trigger (with triggers set to the shallowest hair-trigger setting).. I ordered replacement controllers and... they have the same issue: A button presses do not always register! It's a shame, because otherwise the controllers look and feel really, really nice.. At this point I am thinking the A button problem is is either a design flaw or a pervasive production issue (such as a defect in the A button plastic molding/membrane/circuit board printing).

3,1.0,"Do not buy this controller without a thorough understanding of the questionable durability of this product.. Elite Controller Series 1 has several very well documented design flaws. Simply search Amazon for Elite Controller Replacement, and you will find a whole cottage industry of replacement bumpers to address the most common flaw. Replacements for rubber grips falling off, replacement analog sticks for stick drift are other well documented but less frequent problems, that have replacement parts that can be purchased third party.. The problems with series 1 were not related to misuse.. Eventually, in response to widespread community complaint, Microsoft opened up their replacement policy. Rightfully so. The controller durability required it.. Therefore, it was with great fanfare that series 2 was released, with reported attention to each of these systemic issues.. The update was met with near universal praise. The early going was fantastic.. Unfortunately, the cat is now out of the bag. Worldwide the controller is less than 1 year old, being only released last October. And now the plethora of durability issues are again becoming evident.. The most frequently documented is ""bumper double clicking"" and ""A button (or face button) sticking."" Less frequent are complaints again reporting stick drift, and problems with bluetooth connectivity.. Unfortunately, I have not been spared these concerns. Several weeks ago, I began to experience the right bumper double clicking. Within several days, the problem progressed to involve the left bumper. Within a week, the right bumper would not register anymore.. I do not misuse my equipment, and the total hours of use low.. An internet search for Elite 2 problems will quickly identify that these shortcomings are once again systemic, and the number of persons affecting is growing on a daily basis.. A formal press release was published by Microsoft in November confirming hardware problems affecting gamers. There has been no formal follow up since that admission.. Once you experience these durability issues, which unfortunately I expect you will, you will find yourself seeking recourse.. When you follow the standard microsoft/xbox online support mechanisms, you will find that, unless the controller is within 90 days of purchase, your efforts will be fruitless. At the end of the process, you will receive an email that simply states the product is out of the replacement window. No other recourse will be offered.. 90 days for a $180 device? This is not acceptable you will think.. Flabbergasted, you will be compelled to pursue the issue further. However, you will find thereafter, that it is not possible to speak to a live representative from microsoft about this problem. It is not possible. You will reach a dead end anyway you turn.. Eventually, if you continue to be frustrated enough at the perceived injustice to continue, you might find that, to connect to a live person, you have to pretend you have a different problem. If you pretend for example, that you would like to end your subscription to xbox live, you will then receive a call back from a live person. That person will be of no help, because they are on the software side, and your problem is hardware related. They state however, that they will transfer you to the hardware side. The connection may or may not go through. However, if you are persistent enough going through this side channel, you may eventually be connected to hardware support.. Support will state that they are aware of the problem, and ""a ticket has been sent to the back end team."". What does that mean? you will ask. The response is repeated by the support team ""a ticket has been sent to the back end team."". Doesn't this solve your concern? Is this response not self explanatory? Are you not satisfied?. Of course not. There is no time table provided. There is no mechanism for follow-up provided. No fix provided. No assurance that anything will happen at all. Meanwhile, you will find yourself with a $180 paper weight.. To be clear, this controller was 5/5 out of the box. Having owned multiple series 1, I preordered series 2 with tremendous excitement, and my early use was fantastic.. But this durability, or lack thereof, is unacceptable. The series 1, despite the numerous short comings, had community fixes for just about every concern. Users like myself learned the repair process, and kept their devices working.. There is no known fix for series 2. We are 100% dependent on Microsoft being forthright and honest, and taking care of their customers.

6,5.0,"This is my third elite controller (had 2 version 1 elites) my biggest issue with my first two elites was the rubber grips coming off and I had some stick drift as well. I never had the issue of broken bumpers that I saw other people have with their v1 elites but Im hoping that is something they also addressed with this new controller. Obviously having this controller only for one day I can't really say if the new designed grips on this controller will hold up but im hoping they do. The New design to the grips do feel good tho.. First thing about this controller I noticed is that it is slightly smaller than the version 1 (this could be something microsoft already mentioned when they announced the version 2 im not sure). Since it slightly smaller it also has a little less weight but it still has that weightiness that the version 1 has just very slightly less.. The back paddle are also smaller and do not extend as much as the v1 paddle, which I think is ultimately a good thing but it will take maybe 30mins/hour to get use to the smaller paddles if you are use to the v1 paddles. The bumpers and triggers are also smaller but it still feels normal.. Also the thumbsticks of the v1 controller are NOT compatiable with the v2 controller. And that is because the v2 has the new tension adjusting mechanic in the stick, so the thumbsticks themselves have new designs. As for the thumbstick that come with the controller: 2 short concave stick (smooth on the top surface but having a textured mesh-like on the sides like the typical v1 sticks), 1 short convex/dome stick with a textured patterned, 2 short wide surface concave sticks, 1 long concave stick (essentially the same as the v1 long concave stick). Im currently using the 2 short wide surface stick as I like the extra surface area of the sticks.. It comes with long USB-C charging cable too and has a slot to insert the USB-C cord into to charge the controller on a charging dock that is inside case but of course you can just connect the USB cord directly to the controller to charge and play at the same time which is probably the way most of us will charge the controller but still a nice feature nonetheless.. Only con I would have is my X button feels a bit stickier/stiffer than the A,B,Y buttons but im hoping that goes away as press the X more and more.. I will say this controller is overall better than the v1 from design to feel to look but If you have a v1 elite already and are not suffering from the grips, stick drift. or broken button issues then you probably dont need to upgrade unless the tension stick adjusting and more button config profile, other things the v1 dont have are very important to you.

While the new Series X controllers have imported some of the improvements (texture on the grips and on the triggers), the elite has a satisfying heft to it. I feel like you could defend yourself from a home invasion wielding one of these, and if anyone discovers how much you have spent on just a controller they may also think you have priceless jewelry or artwork waiting to be plundered so perhaps that's a real risk. Also: paddles are great for some games.. Now to take away 3 stars: I only managed to get through one game before the controller began failing. For the record, the full game was Jedi: Fallen Order, not an experience that seemed inordinately demanding on the left controller. And I will say I very much enjoyed remapping the force push and pull to the paddles.. Alas, I then started playing Dark Souls 3. About half way through my character began spontaneously walking forwards at inopportune moments. Yes, controller drift (on the left stick) had struck. This got progressively more severe until the controller was unusable. In case you're wondering, at no point had I thrown the controller around in the midst of rage quitting out of a troublesome boss: under those circumstances I just summon help, like the massive scrub I am. Yes, I pressed up on the controller a lot, but that's *a lot* of games that make you do that.. This sadly doesn't seem to be an isolated problem. I find it odd that this should be happening to so many people seeing Microsoft have ample experience producing perfectly serviceable and (in my experience) robust normal XBox controllers. It's also really expensive compared to those controllers. I want to say ""you get what you pay for"", but obviously you don't. The Scuf controller I bought to replace this, while not feeling quite as fancy, has also held up much better.. The only reason this review isn't one star is because if it fails as quickly for you as it did for me, it should still be covered by some sort of warranty so at least you might not be completely out of luck. In general, like an OLED TV and the fear of burn-in, this seems like one of those rare times you actually do want to take advantage of an extended warranty if it's available to you, for the peace of mind. If you are super price-sensitive you probably aren't considering this controller anyway, so consider the added expense as just the cost of doing business for that sweet paddle action.. So despite my paltry two star review, I would actually consider buying this again with a suitable extended warranty. Am I an idiot? Don't answer that.",Elite Series 2 Controller - Black,0.14154882154882156,0.5497306397306397

9,4.0,"I've been a fairly avid gamer most of my life, and made the transition to using the Xbox at age 13. Until turning 23, I have only used stock controllers and relatively cheaper variants due to being young. At this point in my life, I can comfortably afford to spend more money on more premium products for that enhanced quality. Three and a half months ago, I made this decision for my console gaming experience when I bought this controller. My qualms are not so much with the controller's amenities but rather the longetivity.. The ergonomics of the controller itself are great. It has a textured grip to improve handling of the controller, interchangeable joysticks and D-pads, paddles to increase variability to your gaming, adjustments to trigger pull for the FPS junkies out there, and a plethora of options for customizing what buttons do in the Accessories App. You can even use one button like a SHIFT key on your keyboard, allowing for even more options. I thoroughly enjoy using this controller as I learned to use the paddles. The paddles by default replace the ""A,"", ""B,"", ""X,"" and ""Y"" buttons. This addition allows you to play games without having to move your thumbs with the exception of the D-pad, Start/Select buttons, and Xbox button. For someone really into FPS, this increases your efficiency by a notable amount once it is learned. I had a fantastic time using this controller when I gamed in my free time, until the drift came.. My controller's left joystick has drift on its Y-Axis. What a controller should do once you release the joystick is return to the center. This keeps your character from moving when you do not intend for them to do so. What my controller does is keep the joystick tilted ever so slightly up or down, keeping my character moving in that direction when gaming and making it a hell of a challenge to select anything with an in-game cursor. I will use Apex Legends as an example. I jump onto a narrow ledge to make use of its elevation and I have a sniper with a scope. While aimed in, I make a slight movement up to see just a bit better. Next thing I know, I am falling off of that ledge to likely 50m below, where there were some enemies sneaking by and now I am dead. That slight movement of my character without my intent will cause issues like that to happen on a constant. The problem is even worse when I need to ping to my team for ammo, a certain attachment, or even to drop an item in my inventory. When accessing your inventory in Apex, you use a circular in-game cursor and move it with your joystick to individual items. Imagine how hard that becomes when my cursor keeps going up/down unless I take extra time to steady the stick to the center. That seemingly small problem impairs gameplay to the point I almost don't even use the controller and use a stock controller instead.. I had actually never had joystick drift until getting an Elite Controller. Due to various reasons, I have been very busy these past few months, making me forgetful or at times unable to contact Microsoft, I got to contacting them this week for help as I did not want to void any warranty trying to fix a nearly $200 controller on my own. However, in a timely manner, I get a response telling me I can't be helped as I am past my warranty. I bought this controller on the 9th of February and got this response today, on the 27th of May. Not even 4 months past the purchase of this item, Microsoft will refuse to provide any help. Now I am hoping I can get some results from AMEX as I bought this controller with that card for an extended coverage of the item. If you buy this, be extremely careful with it, try to clean it, and do what you can to prevent development of a problem down the line as Microsoft will only stand by a nearly $200 controller for 90 days.",Elite Series 2 Controller - Black,0.06499711399711398,0.4557128427128427

1,2.0,"Let me count the ways Microsoft screwed this one up.. -Abysmal quality control.. --I've gone through 6 of these controllers and EVERY SINGLE ONE has had the same problems. Sticky face buttons, sticky triggers, and unresponsive A button.. -Garbage warranty. --Microsoft only offers a 90 day warranty... on a nearly $200 product. If you want the extended two year warranty, you need to PURCHASE IT FOR $20 from the Microsoft store.. -Random disconnects. --The controller has bluetooth! Hooray! Only problem is that it randomly disconnects mid boss fight and the only way to reconnect it is to hold down the power button for 10 seconds to hard shutoff, remove it from the paired devices list in your computer, then RE-PAIR IT with the computer. Rinse and repeat every 45 minutes to an hour of gameplay. OR buy their stupid adapter that you're not supposed to need. My $45 8bitdo controller has never had a single connection issue over BT, I can't imagine why this ""Elite"" controller can't get it right.. Honestly, for $180+, this controller is a flaming garbage fire. It's so close to being good, but it's kneecapped by it's incredible failures at basic functionality that it makes it a non-starter. I'm blown away by this thing somehow having 4.5 stars in Amazon. This controller is the basis for an ongoing CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT over stick drift and quality issues.. This controller is so notoriously bad that there's one of the largest reddit threads of all time (in r/xboxone) made up of fans who just wanted to get a working elite controller, most of which have bought and RMA'ed multiple (some, up to 12 units) elite controllers over the period of several months to years. I finally gave up after receiving my 6th one and realizing that they must all be defective, since every single unit I've received has the exact same core problem (the A button), with a surprise grab bag of other problems (sticky buttons, stick drift, leaking adhesive on the thumbsticks, etc).. So, TL:DR. -Don't waste the next 3 months of your life warranty swapping this melted turd over and over again hoping for a golden onion. It's not gonna happen.. And don't trust these 5 star reviews.. If you do decide you like pain, go ahead and drop your $200 and roll the dice, but the first thing you should do is plug it in to your PC, open the Xbox controller app software, and check each and every button many times.

Sadly I‚Äôm returning the controller due to the ‚ÄúA‚Äù button not registering being pressed consistently. I‚Äôve done all the troubleshooting steps. I‚Äôve updated the firmware. I‚Äôve played with it the last 2 days, and if anything it‚Äôs getting worse.. This being Microsoft, they‚Äôll work out the kinks eventually...? I tried to exchange it through Xbox support and was disconnected, so I‚Äôm getting a refund and might try again in a year. I‚Äôve been an Xbox gamer for 14+ years and I‚Äôve learned being an early adopter is hit or miss. For the price you would think it was thoroughly tested before being shipped.. As for the controller it does feel premium. The rubberized grip is nice, but takes getting used to. The battery is a beast, and after playing for 2 days it was still registering almost full.

You will experience stick drift within a week or two of use, and it will annoy you like crazy. There is no fix for this drift, and it will continue to get worse with time.. Likewise, for some reason, these controllers also have weak switches on the back. These switches are incredibly fragile and are made out of incredibly cheap materials. It is very embarrassing how Microsoft continues to attempt to milk their loyal gaming community by dishing out cheap, poorly made products.. While the controller worked, it was amazing.

7,5.0,"Good controller. I‚Äôve had two of the first generation Elites. The bumper trigger broke on the first one (lasted a bit more than two years) and the rubber grip pads eventually fell off. Bought a second one (used) and got 6 months before the rubber grip pads started falling off. (Not complaining, but these earlier versions definitely had some issues.). This one is the second generation and I like it. The grips feel different - more secure and hopefully less likely to come loose.. The internal rechargeable battery is cool. It ‚Äúclicks‚Äù magnetically with the charger and I really like that.. The bumper triggers have three settings for depth of trigger pull - as opposed to two on the older version. I like that too and set it into the middle. Deep enough I feel it, but not so deep it causes problems in quick reactions.. The metal button flippers on the bottom feel tighter - much better than the ones on the earlier version. The old ones would sometimes work themselves loose during heated PvP for me. These ones on the new controller just feel more ‚Äúsnug.‚Äù. All in all, I can tell engineers paid attention and worked through a lot of old issues. Definitely a good purchase for me.

I was hopeful that the v2 would be an improvement and so far it definitely has been almost everywhere. The charge works great and lasts a very long time. The paddles have been shortened and feel way better which is weird because I didn't think that was something that needed to be improved. The grip is worse but feels more durable so I can live with that. I love the fact I can store an additional profile and a default setting. I also like the tension you can put on the sticks. I use the default tension, but it's great that is an option. Overall this feels like a really solid improvement. I've used it for a month now without any issues.

As a lady that enjoys playing video games with my husband I honestly expected to be able to play full multiplayer in this game.

7,1.0,"This game would be so close to perfect -- the graphics are gorgeous, the new options for customization and design are excellent, and Nook Miles are a fun addition. HOWEVER, its one fatal flaw is how greatly secondary players are hamstrung, and it's enough of an issue for us that it takes a lot of my enjoyment out of the game and eclipses all the positives.. I was the one to start the game on our Switch because I had a day off work, and therefore relegated my partner's save file to being a sidekick that can't contribute to the main storyline or placement of buildings, and is stuck waiting on whatever progress I make in the game. Even though I have the ""privilege"" of being the first player and RR, my enjoyment in the game is totally shot because I know I took the ""good"" spot from my partner.. We'd GLADLY buy a second copy of the game so we could each have our own island, but we can't afford to purchase an entire second Switch just because Nintendo can't get their act together..

8,1.0,"I have not played the game and can not play the game the way I want to. My wife and I share a Switch which means we must share an island. This is not the way either of us wants to play the game. I am sure some people will like sharing an island but why not give us an option and not force us to share.. Nintendo makes great games but there are some areas they are horrible at. People sharing a console has been one of them for years. (I have owned every Nintendo console since the first and all the handhelds since the Gameboy).. I understand why early on with limited resources and memory having multiple people have their own save games was an issue. For years it was only 3 saves on a cartridge (four games in a family, sorry someone loses out) but as technology advanced this is an area where Nintendo did not for a long time. I thought once they started having multiple user logins per device we were over that but here we are again. The only way for everyone to have their own island in the new Animal Crossing is to buy separate consoles. This is not acceptable in 2020.

Whoever the first person is to play the game is the only one who can advance the ‚Äòstory‚Äô and build up the town.

The game is exactly what you would expect from Animal Crossing, only enhanced. It is better, the entire town can be customized to your imagination with few limitations.

8,3.0,"Ho boy. I'm not sure where to begin. There is really a lot to say about the long awaited addition to the Animal Crossing family and to be fair, some of it is positive. To be honest, plenty of the criticism is deserved as well.. As a mother of four kids and a fan of the game myself (yep, I played it on the wii and fell in love. The ONLY video game I've ever truly been a fan of- what can I say? It helps me de-stress!), I'm not going to pull any punches when I say that the one island per Switch thing is ridiculous and could in fact damage future development and/or releases. This is a deal breaker for a lot of families. We went ahead and bought the game knowing this was an issue but were hoping to give it a try. After all, we shared City Folk just fine. But one of the main issues is that the person who starts the game sort of gets everything and takes over the development of the island while the other players are just kind of left in the dust for a while. Sure, they still gain points, manage their homes, get DIY plans, but everything they do comes slower, fewer, and is held up by the first player. They're not really creating their own story- they're following in the shadows of the story the first player started. I say that as the first player of our game and it stinks. I would have loved to have passed on some of the challenges and rewards to my kids to complete but instead I just felt rushed to get as much done as possible so they could progress as well.. Another interesting tidbit- and many won't care about this but conservative parents might so I'm mentioning it for them- are the few LGBT references in the American or English version of the game. The Japanese version strangely doesn't contain these references but they were included in the English version and this is notable to me. I firmly believe in equal rights but in what is very much a children's game with talking animals, I fail to understand how it was necessary to include these references. Why do sexual preferences even need to play a part in a game such as this? Without warning, the creators have chosen to include references that feel out of place and a bit like pandering. I'm left scratching my head and wondering, ""Why?"" And if it was so important to include, why was it left out of other versions? Can't we decide what we deem appropriate for our home and kids rather than having Nintendo make a blanket determination of our culture and then plopping something into the game that they won't even include in their country's version? It's just an odd choice for this type of game. If this seems vague, search it out. The information about this is available. Another issue along these lines is the deletion of gender. I'm aware that there was a group of people that wanted non-binary options in the game, but it seems that gender pronouns have been erased entirely in only the US version. Players are referred to as ""they"" and ""their"" by the animals. This is probably my biggest gripe. There is a VERY small population of the US that identifies as completely non-binary. Of that group, it's another small population that plays animal crossing, but any references to ""she"" and ""he"" have been replaced in the game with ""they."" My entire family would prefer to have our pronouns of ""she"" or ""he"" used but, so far, this is not an option. It would be great if we could at least choose to have standard pronouns acknowledged rather than erasing the option entirely. An update would take care of this.. As far as some of the changes, like crafting your own tools, there is good and bad. It can be fun to get new plans for building and it adds an element of excitement as the game progresses. However, it can be incredibly tedious trying to constantly gather resources for the many tasks you will have thrown at you. And as the first player, you will be hogging resources the other players will need as well and there simply aren't enough to go around at first. I quickly grew tired of having to gather, gather, gather for Nook's demands when I really wanted to just explore the island. But much of your exploration largely depends on getting those things done.. Also, some islands start off with only about a quarter or less of the island available to build on. We stupidly chose one of those not realizing we wouldn't have access to the rest of the island for a while. This meant we had to place four human player tents, two animal tents, the museum, and Nook's nephews' shop all in the same tiny area. Needless to say, some of us are relocating as soon as that becomes an option because we're all horribly cramped into one space. Keep in mind, relocating is expensive. It becomes more expensive as the game progresses and you gain more control over the island's design.. As for some of the positives, the graphics are lovely and pleasing. The island setting is fun and the water, the sounds, the scenery are awesome. This makes for delightful game play. They nailed the sound of rain, the distant rumble of thunder, the wind picking up in the afternoon- such fun elements!! Visiting other islands is a cool bonus even if it does get a bit tedious when four islands in a row are pretty much the same, but it's a great way to pick up resources. The animal characters are more interactive, have more personality, and are fun to watch as they seem to do their own thing rather than walk around aimlessly. In spite of its flaws, there is something delightful and addictive about the game.. Some fun bonuses: tarantulas are a bit easier to catch, you can uproot trees and just transplant them whole from other islands if you eat fruit first, and you can bring harder to find flowers in crossbred colors from other islands and transplant them on your island (this is rare however!). Also, after acquiring shoots from other islands, you can grow bamboo on your own island. This is a fun bonus, however, so far, I've visited about about 8-10 other islands and haven't seen another type of fruit other than my own and only came across bamboo once. My son has visited other islands about the same amount and has only seen one other type of fruit.. All in all, this game offers some pleasant entertainment and a nice escape from real life for a bit. I'm giving it sound 3 stars because the verdict is still out- I need to see how things develop before I decide if this was a fail or if it will unfold nicely over time. Overall, there is some disappointment and frustration, but the positives are worth noting so I can't pan it. Hopefully, as time passes and updates are made available, we'll be pleasantly surprised, but until then, I'm not going to gush about this game.. Edited 3/27: I'm going to add another half star to one star. Things are picking up and there are more fun bonuses we've discovered as a family as we've played. The other players still don't have as many diy plans as the original player and they've missed out on some things because of their status in the game, but those things become less important as the game progresses. A few still cause issues but we're hoping that will be fixed in the future. In the meantime, there are a lot of things that make this game worth playing and it's easy to see the incredible work that was put into creating the game. So. . . For our family of six, we're currently giving it 3.5 to 4 stars after one week of consistent game play.. Edited 4/21: Plan on having to spend a LOT of time to get the necessary DIY recipes to create furniture. The game is designed to absolutely need an online connection and to play with friends so you can get every type of fruit, flower, DIY recipe, etc. Count on months and months of consistent playing in order to unlock a few things to decorate your house unless you catalog with other players. Count on a lot of repeat DIY recipes you won't need, few furniture options for long periods of time, and count on having to track down other players in online forums in order to catalog items or share resources because there is no other reliable method of getting what you need. I don't like my kids playing with strangers or inviting strangers into our island (I didn't in past AC versions and we did just fine) and I don't have friends who are playing so this puts families like mine in a difficult situation. I appreciate that there were more options in past AC versions for people who didn't want to do a lot of online play but it seems ACNH depends very much on online interaction and help. Hopefully some future updates will remedy this. In the the meantime, our score remains at around 3.5 to maybe 4 stars.",Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch,0.059352790750574,0.48070959418250114
9,2.0,"The Nintendo Switch has one of the best profile systems of any game console. Each player can have their own profile, and games saves are kept completely separate.. Because of this, I was very surprised to discover that Animal Crossing: New Horizons goes out of its way to circumvent the profile system. The first player to play the game is given the full experience. All other players are given a downgraded experience. Parts of the game are just missing, like naming your island, or choosing its layout. And all players are forced to have the same island, with limited space and limited resources.. If I'd known this, I wouldn't have purchased this game, as we have one Switch shared by two kids. How is it fair to let one of them be the ""island representative"", while the other is treated as a second-class citizen by the game? One can unlock things, invite others, etc., while the other can only do tasks that don't actually advance the story?. I see others trying to excuse Nintendo's behavior here, saying ""Animal Crossing has always been like that"", but:. 1. This is false. On the 3DS you could only have one game save per cartridge, but you could use multiple cartridges with a single 3DS. On the Switch you need two separate consoles.. 2. When classic games with limited save slots are ported to the Switch, the number of save slots from the original are normally made *per-profile* on the Switch. For example, in Link's Awakening there are only 3 save slots. In the Switch version, there are 3 save slots *per-profile*. Likewise, one would expect that Animal Crossing would have one game save *per-profile* on the Switch.. 3. Having mis-features in the past is not an excuse for propagating them into the future.. Nintendo went out of their way to make the game terrible for anyone but the first player. It's pretty clear that their motivation for this is greed. Instead, they've made me strongly consider returning this game, and avoiding their platform in the future.",Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch,-0.033029361942405425,0.4347261434217956

3,4.0,"I want to be very clear: I absolutely adore this game.. It is beautifully done. It's peaceful, meditative and engaging. It is everything I love about this kind of game. It rewards adventure and whimsy, and I am loving working to slowly develop my island and invite new faces to it. I haven't felt so invested in a game like this, so fulfilled, since Stardew Valley.. But here's the thing. I'm Player One of Three in my household. And for Player Two and Three, it is still enjoyable but a far less fulfilling experience.. Having everyone on the same system share one island is not the end of the world. We personally like that. We would have liked the option to have our own private islands to sculpt, but whatever. What we don't like is that the experience P1 gets is not the same experience P2 and P3 get. I get to build relationships with villagers, I get quests to unlock buildings, I get to move the story forward--and they just kinda hang out and have to wait for me to do it. They don't get to actually participate in the story for the most part, and feel like bystanders in their own save of the game. Even their interactions with the villagers so far don't seem to matter as much. That just feels bad. I was so excited when I realized they would want to play this with me, and felt so sorry when I realized they would only get a fraction of the experience I was getting. Over the past couple of days, we keep stumbling over things they are ultimately missing out on or don't have access to as additional players, and I keep feeling the need to apologize.. Not to mention, if any of us play to our hearts desire on any given day, the other two hop on later to find there is little for us to do, no resources left to collect. There are three of us. I have no idea how this island and its resources is supposed to support up to eight players.. I hope the developers of this game seriously weigh the feedback they're getting on this and patch in something that at least attempts a compromise. Please give P2 + a unique storyline experience of their own that actually matters--something not tied to P1 progress.. The Direct for this game asks, ""What kind of life do -you- want to live?"". This household's answer: the kind Player One gets to have.",Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch,0.08551484230055659,0.5500587507730365
4,1.0,A very disspointing game. Basically meant for one player. The other players can play but have very limited capabilities. They cannot advance in the game unless the main player has not advanced and unlocked tools etc. Definitely not a family game.... What were they game creators thinking???? Does everyone in one household have their switch consoles??? For sixty bucks game this is not good for group play individual play unless youbare the only players. I hope they do some kind of update to this feature otherwise i will be returning in a day or 2.,Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch,-0.12007936507936506,0.47960317460317464
5,2.0,"Gameplay wise. No complain. It is the best Animal Crossing experience period.. Biggest problem is that there is no way for your family members to have their own experience with the game fully. There is one island and the primary user is teh only one that has the full access to the game. Other users on the Switch profiles get to have ""secondary"" experience where you get to live in the island the primary user set up and have limited gameplay.. This would not be an issue if it was on previous consoles where each console meant it belongs to a single user and multiple user/usage was not encouraged.. Since Nintendo switched to account based system with multiple user to access single machine, it really makes no sense that they would make a game where other users are gimped and not allowed to have their own save files.. This is compounded by the fact that the save files are stored in the internal memory of Switch unit. This means even if you buy multiple copies of the game for your family members, they can not have their own full game experience on one device. You have to buy a new switch and a game with every single house member.. Totally makes no sense.",Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch,0.06469832251082251,0.42521645021645027

7,5.0,"I remembered buying Animal Crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS back when it was released in america via 2013, while Japan got the game in later 2012. New Leaf was absolutely INCREDIBLE! It is the perfect game for the Nintendo 3DS and it is an insanely addicting game that is VERY hard to put down. The first 3-6 months I played new leaf anywhere between 2-5 hours per day. Then eventually I played it for 1-3 hours per day because there is ALWAYS something new to buy and do. I clocked in 1,325 hours for New Leaf according to my Nintendo 3DS playing time logs. My nephew accidentally started a new save file over my 1,325 hours file save. I stopped playing then cause I didnt feel like doing it all over again. Then, new horizons was announced and the whole world rejoiced! New Horizons absolutely blew my expectations of the game cause I was slightly worried the game would feel more like the portable version aka Animal Crossing: Wild Word for the original Nintendo DS and of course Animal crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS. Now, dont get me wrong, both portable games were stellar and absolutely FUN. However, animal crossing fans still miss the original Animal Crossing gamecube game cause that game was truly the best animal crossing game. I am glad and happy to say that Animal Crossint New Horizons for the Switch, definitely brings you back to the joy of playing the original game on the gamecube. New Horizons has so much new additions added that it really feels like a BIG console game rather than a not so big game on the handhelds. I've logged about 15 hours already into new horizons and I've already put more time into New Horizons than I did with New Leaf during the first 48 hours of owning this game. One example of New Horizons many features in the game is the terraforming addition. Yes, you read correctly! You can move mountains and dirt in order to design your island EXACTLY the way you want it to be. Being able to cross a river without going around it by finding a different detour path, you can add dirt/ground into the river, then simply walk over to the other side of the land. Just wait till you unlock that feature in the game cause I never knew animal crossing needed a feature like that and I'm extremely happy the devs added that into the game. Anyways, I dont want to spoil anything else, just BUY this game asap. I strongly recommend you buy the physical copy of the game cause then if anything happens to your save file on the switch, you could end up losing it and never get it back due to Nintendo cloud saving feature being totally backwards. Only allowing one save file and each save file is for that specific switch you own. However, if you buy the physical copy of new horizons, at least your save file will always be saved in that cartridge copy of animal crossing new horizons. Apologized for the long nonsense review of this game but seriously buy it!",Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch,0.047032828282828266,0.45640772341353714
8,2.0,"I wanted to like this so much, my family and I have been HUGE Animal Crossing fans for years (since DS) and have been looking forward to this for about a year. Some thoughts:. PROS:. 1. Same known mechanics and characters - fishing, bug catching, customization of your home. 2. The pixel-art creator is amazing. Love it.. 3. Visiting other islands, sharing, and mail. CONS:. 1. Multi-player needs to be split screens. Right now, it's a single-player game. All other players are ""tag-alongs"" and you can't even view the screen correctly. Horrible execution whoever designed this.. 2. One island per cartridge. It's a nice idea, but should have been an OPTION not the only way. My kids want their own island to build up. Forcing one household on one island is pretty greedy of Nintendo.. 3. You are REQUIRED to pay for Nintendo Online to visit other islands, for EACH user account. We have one Nintendo Online account, but for my kids to visit their friends island, EACH of US needs to PAY FOR OUR OWN Nintendo Online account ($20/each per year) Seriously messed up greed on the part of Nintendo for that..

6,5.0,"This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)).. So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.. I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings.. So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime).. Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.",Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‚ÄëCon - HAC-001(-01),0.13444444444444445,0.5026455026455027

9,5.0,"This revised model of the Switch comes with a number of features that I honestly can't fully appreciate as someone who didn't own the previous model. The big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life, even though so far I haven't played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop, but they use the same amount of battery either way I would imagine. The reason I'm giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else. But I pretty much expected as much. I'm sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system, but in case you're wondering here, this one comes with the system, two gray joycons, two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller, a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller, the required cables, and the Switch dock. So you'll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an SD card for reasonable storage space, a pro controller for a more standard controller experience, maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system, an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features... just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself. This will inflate the price further, but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the Switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now. So... basically, if you want a cheaper Switch you'll want to get a Switch Lite and this one will still cost about 300 bucks like the 2.5+ year-old original variant still costs. That is, unless you want to go used. I'm only bringing up these points because while this is a great system, I do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly. Once I realize a Switch was still going to cost the same if I wanted the ability to do on and off TV play I decided I might as well just hop on board with this newer variant. I'd recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model. Otherwise, if price is a concern, wait for the Switch Lite and see how it tickles your fancy. Also, here's tip. If you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode, simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down. Also note that you cannot play on the TV off of the Switch's battery power. The dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function.

I installed all my games, transferred data, and now I am stuck with wiping and returning it or just settling for a mediocre version of the switch. Thanks for the annoyance Amazon!

4,5.0,"In terms of raw horsepower (CPU, graphics, whatever) the Nintendo Switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the XBox One. But, the Switch is a unique device. As a handheld, it is quite powerful (the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld's battery life, addressing the Switch's greatest weakness). This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability.. Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it. Software is what makes or breaks a console, no matter how good it is.. For example the Zelda game ""Breath of the Wild"" is a visual stunner with a huge open world. And this is the first portable system that has the full version of Skyrim available for it (the reason I bought it --- a high quality port of Skyrim with the 3 add-on packs). Nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as ""Mario Kart 8"" as well as a lot of new titles such as ""Super Smash Brothers Ultimate"" or ""Luigi's Mansion 3"".. In addition,their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as Stardew Valley.. Also, if you purchase the Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20/year) Nintendo also gives you a large selection of NES and SNES classic games. The membership is worthwhile for that alone.. Basically, because Nintendo is ONLY selling the Switch as a current console (the 3DS is on its way out), all of their best software goes to the one console. And that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well.. If you want a wide variety of games, the Switch is a good choice. If you want THE best console graphics or performance, obviously the Switch isn't for you.",Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‚ÄëCon - HAC-001(-01),0.22010166916416918,0.5293330974580975

6,1.0,"It's incredibly disappointing to see nothing but overpriced third party sellers are distributing this product, and the fact that I had to sign up on several stock-tracking websites just to have a chance at owning this console is more than disheartening.. To top it all off, the game itself feels like a huge downgrade compared to its predecessor, New Leaf. Not only are several quality-of-life improvements missing, but tons of content such as the Dream Suite, Happy Home Showcases, deep sea diving, and more are absent. Why is island-visiting the only option for multiplayer when multiplayer island tours existed in New Leaf? Surely not because of hardware limitations? Villager dialogue feels empty and simple, devoid of personality aside from their preassigned type. And let's not even start on the One Island Per Switch discourse.. Not only was getting ahold of this console an absolute nightmare, but having to pay $60 for a game that feels unfinished is a disgrace.

There was absolutely NO damage or flaws of any kind, and even playing GTA online or Call of Duty, the fan never kicks up at all ... if the room is quiet, I can hear the fan running at a very low RPM when it's working hard. I don't know if the refurb process replaced the factory thermal compound or not, but when you have a gaming console start to get noisy from the fan kicking on, 9.9 times out of 10, all you have to do is take it apart and put in new thermal compound between the CPU, GPU and the heat sync and you'll be good to go. That stuff is really only good for 3 to 5 years so be mindful of it and your console will last a long time.. For the price, I would say this is an EXCELLENT deal.

The packaging was great, awesome refurb job from Amazon, I was fearing the worst especially from a discontinued product.. it was like NEW! only the small white box containing the power cord was damaged, everything else was like a brand new product.. After unpacking the console, I installed AC: Valhalla, and WOW, my mind was immediately blown away, like night and day compared to my old Xbox One... didn't know a game would look so beautiful and run so smoothly (I have no idea what's the big deal is this 60FPS after playing my game in 30 FPS in 4K),. I have zero regret making this purchase instead of waiting for a series X (and obviously not paying those stupid prices from scalpers).. From what I understand it's gonna be at least 2 or 3 more years before we actually see games fully optimized for Serie X, so all in all, I fully recommend anyone wanting to get a MASSIVE boost in graphic quality from your old Xbox One, it's real!

It got here, looked great, didn't seem like anything was wrong with it. Started downloading games onto it and that's when it started acting up. It kept error coding, we reset it and thought that would solve the issues. We had it for a week and it was error coding DAILY, multiple times a day. I can not tell you how many times we reset the thing either. It was to the point where the thing wasn't even useable. We contacted Microsoft about it because we thought it was something to do with an update. We found out it was actually an internal issue... which this company should have taken care of before shipping it out. They claimed that they've done testing before sending it out.. if that were true then we wouldn't be having this issue. It took a matter of hours for this issue to come up. We just ended up sending it directly to Microsoft because we wanted it fixed properly this time.

5,5.0,"After reading the reviews, I will admit I was a little apprehensive in buying a renewed xbox one x. Especially since the one advertised was $100 less than I had previously seen on Amazon. But, since it was a great deal and I knew I wouldn't find it or less, I went a head and bought it. I am so happy that I did. I actually waited to write my review until I had used the xbox for a while, since it seems others had issues after using it for a few days. Well, I purchased it on Feb 11 and it is now March 25 and not one issue. In fact, I even signed up for preview builds and have gotten a few updates since my purchase. I am able to game using 4k graphics for hours with no issues, no heating up, nothing wrong at all. I have a 55"" 4k TV and the video from the xbox is amazing. I play heavy graphic games like Destiny 2, Call of Duty and others so at first I kept a close eye on the machine. I can literally game with heavy graphics for hours - like 4 -5 hours at a time and no issues. I also watch 4k streaming on Hulu and Netflix with no issues there either. The xbox did come in a generic box with only the power cord and wireless controller, but I get Gamepass Ultimate free through Bing rewards, so I wasn't too worried about not getting the Xbox Live Gold subscription. Also, I had extra HDMI cables, so again not an issue. As for looks, the machine looks brand new and the label says it was made in 2019, so maybe I got one that was not actually renewed, I dunno. There is no certified renewed sticker from Microsoft like they would put on it. All I know is, it works awesome and looks brand new, so I am happy. I would definitely recommend getting one. I use instant on, so it loads really fast and I can use my Android app to download games on the go, or use my voice via Google Assistant and turn the machine on/off, or to record things as I am playing rather than using the controller options in a ""heavy situation.""

0,1.0,"Do your research carefully before you buy this mouse. In order to configure the mouse, you have to use Razer's Synapse software, which forces you to surrender all your data privacy through its disgusting EULA (End User License Agreement). Before you can use Synapse, they force you to register and create an account with a valid email address, phone, etc. They will collect all data not only around your usage of this mouse, but also what software you have/used, how often you use them, (and who knows what else they will collect) etc etc.. Moreover, Razer Synapse itself is a bloatware which consumes your PC's processing resources while it's running in the background. Synapse also has questionable security posture. Can it be exploited by malicious hackers or software? Does it make your computer less secure? This is unclear. All we know is that it's there to collect your private data and 'phone home'.. In summary, I think this data collection practice is a gross over reach which we consumers should not tolerate.

1,5.0,"This review is for the Deathadder V2 Pro Wireless.. The Value: 7/10. This mouse is more on the expensive side, but wow did it come in quick. One day shipping, impressive.. The Shape: 10/10. I loved the design of the first Deathadder, and it still reigns supreme. I have huge hands (easily can palm a professional basketball) and I‚Äôve struggled with ‚Äúesports mice,‚Äù notably the Glorious Model O Wireless. Button placement is great and it‚Äôs perfect for right-handed users.. The Buttons/Clicks: 9/10. The buttons and clicks feel a bit hollower compared to the Deathadder 2013. There‚Äôs just a slight more space needed to register a click. This is not a big issue and I‚Äôve adapted fine. Response times are really quick with the new technology.. The Quality: 10/10. The mouse is really well-built. The rubberized sides feel good. It‚Äôs pretty much the Viper Ultimate specs with a different shell. It‚Äôs lighter than the Deathadder 2013 by 20 or so grams, so overall a great mouse.. The Software: 6/10. Here‚Äôs where everybody dumps their complaints. I know, the software requiring a login is dumb and invasive. It‚Äôs part of a higher-level product offering ploy. The fact that upon first plugging in the mouse, the computer pops up with an install for synapse and slows the computer down. I get it. My advice: setup an account, make your changes to RGB (which mine is off anyway), DPI, polling rate, etc., program multiple profiles using the onboard memory (in this case I have two DPI‚Äôs), then request to delete all of your user data through synapse. Delete account, uninstall synapse, then continue to live your life. You‚Äôll be ok. If your worries about a gaming peripherals company ‚Äústealing and selling your data,‚Äù you‚Äôd be surprised of how much of your information you actually give on a daily basis just walking around in public with your Bluetooth on.

2,3.0,"I have had the V2 for about a month now and it feels like a huge improvement over my Deathadder Chroma that died via the double click issue of doom.. Before the pros and con's I want to address a couple of issues you might run into.. First, for the first few days after setting up the mouse every time I would start my pc it wouldn't connect and I would have to unplug it and plug it back in to get windows to recognize it. This was because the Synapse 3 software doesn't for some reason also check for a firmware update for the mouse itself. Quick googling of DeathAdder V2 firmware got me the right link on their website to update it. After that no more issues.. Second issue is a much quicker fix, for those saying they keep changing the dpi via the two top buttons. Just go into the synapse software and under performance you can set the dpi manually to what you want and turn off sensitivity stages which makes the buttons stop changing the dpi.. pros. - super lightweight. - wonderful ergonomics (even for my large hands). - great tracking. - feels sturdy. cons. - software is pretty crap. - Razer support is not gonna support you. - While technically true the mouse has 8 buttons 3 are actually not for gaming. The dpi buttons are only for dpi. I can't assign them to different tasks, and another button is purely for changing profiles on the fly also not a button that can be assigned. So at the end of the day, it's a standard 5 button DeathAdder like all before it. Kinda misleading marketing.. This is actually a great mouse. I have loved using it for the every day or for gaming, but the software and Razer themselves hold it back from being a 5 star product.. Also who needs 20k dpi?!?! honestly",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Mercury White,0.24244663382594417,0.5085385878489328
3,5.0,"I'm really impressed, never thought I'd find a high quality gaming mouse for under $50 but this is it. Only two side buttons but that's about all I use anyway, even when there's a bunch of them. You can adjust the DPI in the software instead of having extra buttons on the mouse, which I like as well.. The software that comes with it lets you adjust the brightness of the led and you can set it to sleep after 5, 10, or 15 minutes, or turn it off. Yes I love gaming but I'm not into all that rgb rainbow lighting, gigantic keyboards and mice that look like they came out of a comic book. Clean, white, and softly lit is very pleasing to me (I turned up the brightness for the pic, normally I keep it just a little brighter than the ambient lighting). Glorious PC makes a white mouse for $90 but it doesn't have that simple, aesthetically pleasing look I was going for, it would have looked out of place on my desktop.

4,5.0,"I had an older version of this mouse before it started having problems with its buttons and replaced it with this newer version. It's a great mouse and a good upgrade!. Right away, I should note that you shouldn't get too fooled/confused by the ""8 programmable buttons"" tagline--it's counting every single button on the mouse, including the standard left and right click and buttons to adjust settings on the bottom of the mouse that you would never use during normal gameplay or computer use. The only two ""extra"" buttons on this mouse for gamebinding are the two on the left side you can click with your thumb. The other buttons are: left and right click, the mouse wheel, two buttons underneath the mouse wheel to adjust the DPI of the mouse, and a button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between profiles. So if you're wanting more buttons to use during gameplay--like, say, having an entire MMO hotbar on your mouse--this isn't the right one. It's useful if you just want to have a couple of buttons that are easily accessed though! I like using my mouse buttons for stuff like push-to-talk and melee attacks in FPS games.. As for the changes compared to the previous version of the Deathadder mouse, they're small but for my use they're good QOL changes. The biggest improvement is the spot underneath the side buttons where you're meant to rest your thumb--in the previous version this was a glued-on rubber pad that game off after a year or so or use. In the V2 mouse, it's now a textured part of the rest of the material of the mouse--the only way it's coming off is if the entire mouse case comes off! I could see the texturing being warn a bit, but that's certainly better than my thumb being gummed up by glue after the pad fell off!. The other main change that I've noticed is that I think this mouse is slightly smaller than the previous version. This is great for me, since I'm a woman with small palms and long, thin fingers--I often have problems using gaming mice and controllers comfortably. That being said, I'm not sure if this would be as comfortable for users with larger hands--if you're worried, I'd suggest seeing if you can get measurements for a mouse you find comfortable and then comparing it to the size of this mouse.. I believe the profile and DPI buttons are also new features, although honestly I haven't messed with that much since I'm not experienced with those settings and I haven't needed it for my own gameplaying. It does seem like a good feature and the buttons seem like they're good quality and I've never accidentally pressed them during gameplay, which is great. Probably want to check other reviews if you need more information there.. Looks-wise, this is simple, but pretty looking mouse. The light on the logo and mouse wheel is really colorful but not bright enough to be distracting when the lights are off in the room. It's pretty easy to use Razer's software to change the color to your tastes, or you can leave it on a default setting where it cycles through various colors in a rainbow order. I know there's also a feature that game devs can use to have the mouse colors be manipulated by the game itself, but I've only ever played one game where I know for sure this was implemented--Overwatch changes the color of the mouse based on the character you're playing as. I don't think it's been used by many other games, and honestly I don't find myself looking at my mouse that much while playing anyway--it's probably a feature that's more fun on keyboards.. Overall, I think this is a really great mouse! I recommend it for people that game on their PC or otherwise use their computer enough to want something that has a few more features and/or is a bit more sturdy than a cheaper mouse. If you're a huge tech nerd or want more button options, it might be a better idea to save up for a more expensive mouse.

6,5.0,"Pros:. -Light weight (80g). -Left and right Optical switches. -Speedflex cable (very, very nearly a paracord, it's really good for a stock cable). -Focus+ sensor with asymmetric cutoff (more on this). -PTFE skates. -Good scroll wheel. -Snappy side buttons. -Fantastic ergo shape. -Synapse software (more on this). -Bright, clean RGB lighting. Cons:. -No extra skates included. Thoughts:. So the con is the only nitpicky thing I could think of. More companies are starting to include extra skates and other components, and I'd like to see razer do the same. Aside from that, the mouse is fantastic. The buttons are very light to press, the weight is really good, etc.... This is a really good update to a very popular classic. Every gamer at some point has owned a Deathadder and each iteration is slightly better than the previous. This one leaps into the modern trends that gamers are asking for. The cable is so flexible it feels wireless, the weight is so light you won't fatigue your wrist or hand during long sessions, the sensor is very accurate, and so on. Speaking of the sensor, I mentioned asymmetric cutoff. Alot of mice let you adjust the lift off distance, this does that and lets you adjust where it starts tracking when you set it down. A little extra control in the players hands. It also has a smart tracking feature that automatically adjusts the liftoff distance based on the surface. Useful if you play on different surfaces often. The synapse software is not required, but does give you extra control over the mouse. You don't need to register an account to download it or use it. You can log in as a guest, fiddle, and uninstall if you want. Keep in mind, this is a large mouse, so if you have small hands, this probably won't be comfortable to you. It is definitely one of the best ergo shapes available. I'd really like to see razer make these in different sizes. All in all, if you like the deathadder, you'll love this upgrade.

7,1.0,"I would think paying over $100 for a mouse would get me the top of the line. If these was some random cheap mouse, I'd understand. However, after using this for 2 weeks now, playing with all the software, debugging, reading forum posts about it, I can only assume this product is still in beta.. You have to download the synapse software which monitors your mouse settings. Great, but it doesn't work like it's supposed to due to buggyness. Here's the kicker though, repairing and/or reinstalling Synapse will result in random bugs - let me explain. Bug #1 may be present so you go to reinstall and it fixes the issue - but now bug #2 and #3 are present. I've never experienced software that does this, it's baffling.. So far, the bugs I've found were:. -[Maybe not a bug] For the mouse to even be recognized, you have to plug it into a usb using a wired connection first. I'm not sure if this is intended.. -Synapse reports X% battery life but clicking the mouse to go deeper into the settings shows a completely different battery life percentage. Not just a percent or two off, logging into synapse showed my mouse had for example, 90% battery life but when I click the mouse to change its settings, it would display 0% battery remaining.. -Synapse would think it's a completely new mouse depending on the USB port it's plugged into. This would trigger a ""reinstall of required software"" and a restart of the computer even though you have everything you need.. -Disconnects several times a day. Every disconnect I experienced was quick, mostly 1-3 seconds and then it would reconnect.. -When switching between DPIs, in the right corner, there is supposed to be a popup that displays what you switched to. Instead, this rarely ever displays and behavior only gets more weird if you plug the mouse into different USB ports. Reinstalling Synapse made it work for a few hours but then it went back to being buggy.. -Battery life, with RGB off and using ""ultra fast mode"" is more so 25-30 hours than their advertised 70 hours.. I know Razer will likely comment below with a copy paste to contact their support and yet I pretty much have. I've went through many of the help forums, read the responses from Razer, applied their suggestions, and nothing fixes it. Secondly, it's clear to me that most of the issues is in regards to software, not the mouse itself.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Mercury White,0.133726035868893,0.5634518655947227

9,5.0,"This is surprisingly a significantly better mouse compared to the V1. I have purchased a lot of razor mice, and had many death adder mice over the years. This version is by far the best that I have tried.. First,. I'm really happy that they removed the side pads and replaced them with something that still feels soft but won't come off. The old pads for your thumb on the left and right of the mouse would come off after about 6 months of use. I would purchase replacement pads and fix it or use epoxy to make a more permanent fix but it was kind of silly that that was such a big pain point. The V2 completely solves that problem.. It also is surprisingly much lighter and it's very noticeable..

1,1.0,"Just bought the V2 and I am very happy with the improvements.. To start I will say both versions of this mouse are made for big hands, I have HUGE hands (biggest out of anyone I know) and it feels great. I cannot speak for people with smaller hands, it may still be good.. (CONS ARE FROM MY V1, NOT THE V2) 3 CONS,. 1. Firstly the reason I finally had to buy V2 was because my first deathadder was having some slight misclicking issues. It would double click sometimes when I only clicked once, but very subtle and rare. It was definitely a little loose but still kind of functional, I just like having perfect hardware so I retired the mouse due to the loose buttons (the side buttons were still working fine, just a little looser than new). To be fair, I can be a HARD clicker under stress lol. It lasted about 1.5 years, not too bad.. 2. I know many people had their side rubbers pop off, and mine kind of did but I was able to re-stick it and it pretty much held up. (This was fixed V2, see PROS). 3. The final and biggest issue for me was the peeling tephlon (teflon?) underneath. My edges started to peel which greatly affected the sliding of the mouse until i had to peel them off, round the edges, and reglue it. This solved the problem but on occasion it would continue to bother me. (This was also fixed V2, see PROS). Now on to the PROS,. 1. The side grips and whole mouse texture is MUCH better than V1. The whole plastic surface is slightly roughed up or something, but it makes it feel WAY better in the hand and not greasy/slippery like my old mouse often felt. Also, the side grips are fused with the body of the mouse, so they wont be popping off! Good job razer. They feel better than the old side grips, too. The overall texture also looks more premium in my opinion compared to the first version.. 2. The tephlon (teflon?) underneath is much better; it is thicker with very round corners. I dont suspect to have any problems here, but I will update if I do. Good job again, razer.. 3. List of small pros, but the updated dpi buttons, mouse wheel, and profile selector underneath the mouse help the refreshed look and feel of the mouse. Also, the braided cable is softer and more floppy than V1, so as long as it holds up, I like it better because it doesnt get in the way so far like the old cable sometimes did.. TL;DR the improvements to V2 deathadder are noticeable, but I probably wouldn't recommend a direct upgrade unless you have problems like I did with V1, or if you are rich :D. Overall the perfect mouse for my giant hands.. Edit: after 2 months the left clicker cracked (wont click anymore), not sure how. Contacted razer and they wont cover the damage and will not send me a replacement. Cannot recommend a product that breaks after 2 months and the company won't back you up for it. Will be purchasing a different brand from now on. I had a good opinion of razer, but no longer.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Mercury White,0.22251251199780606,0.5256406257141549
2,3.0,"This review is for the Razer DeathAdder v2 gaming mouse. I am updating this review after using the mouse for about a month and a half.. My initial impression of the quality was poor because I had to return the first mouse sent to me due to a wiggly left mouse button that shifted left to right. When I received a mouse without that defect I was impressed by its accuracy and ergonomics. My first review was rather glowing.. After playing a number of games with this mouse over the past month I am retiring it because it performs poorly in Starcraft 2, the popular real-time strategy game. That game involves a lot of rapid fire clicking and the action of the buttons on the DeathAdder is too long, mushy abd inconsistent for it to be an effective RTS mouse. In particular the right mouse button, which is mushier and less predictable than the left, makes rapid Move commands of units much less effective.. As a point of reference, I am comparing it to my previous mouse which I am now using again, a Logitech G502 HERO Wired model. I wanted to replace the mouse simply due to wear and tear on the pads and because Logitechs software is terrible, but the crispness and quick action of the buttons on the G502 make the DeathAdder's buttons feel like a cruel joke.. For certain types of games the longer travel on the DeathAdder is not such a big deal. In CS GO, my performance was actually a bit improved due to the weight, ergo and accuracy of the DeathAdder. Also, the mushier right mouse button is irrelevant in that game. However, I'm playing StarCraft 2 way more often lately, for which the DeathAdder is unacceptable.. To describe the right mouse button: It actuates fairly close to the top of the downward click but then continues to travel way too much. When it bottoms out it does not make a hard stop but instead depresses some dampers that Razer intentionally built in to the button. After the somewhat unpredictable bottom out it rebounds too slowly, and you have to let it rebound a long way for it to actuate again.. This means that when twitching on the right mouse button there are a lot of misses -- non-clicks. By contrast, with my Logitech G502 I can issue right clicks at least twice as fast and never miss a beat. By comparison the DeathAdder has incredibly mushier, long-traveling and unpredictable buttons. Especially the right one.. It isn't a defect in my mouse. I inspected it thoroughly and made an attempt to correct the problem, but it stems from design decisions that Razer made: Over reliance on the plastic shell for button rebound, dampers when the buttons bottom out, long travel with a very quick actuation point.. My initial review gave the DeathAdder 4 stars. I liked the way it performed in FPS games. It is very accurate with smooth tracking with all software smoothing disabled. I deducted one star for poor quality control. I am dropping it to 3 stars because a gaming mouse should really have better thought out, crisper and more predictable primary buttons. The problems with the right mouse button are a death knell for the DeathAdder when it comes to StarCraft 2.. As an aside, the Razer Synapse 3 software is leaps and bounds better than Logitech G Hub, but there is no substitute for good, functional hardware. The next mouse I am trying is on the way: A Logitech G Pro Wireless, which promises crisp buttons in a lighter form factor than that G502, which is a bit of a monster in the weight department. I am cautiously hopeful.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Mercury White,0.08048888888888889,0.47507301587301576
3,2.0,"This was my first ever Razer product and I got to say... it's a pretty good mouse for the price. I have a big hand and the mouse is a great fit. The fit, comfortability, and precision of the mouse exceeded my exceptions. And not to mention the satisfying clicks, the smooth programmable buttons on the side, and the tactile scroll wheel. So, you're probably wondering why I gave it a low. Well, Amazon sent me a used Death-Adder. I specifically bought it new from Amazon ( ""shipped and sold from Amazon"" ). So, I'd watch out for that, but honestly that is a rare scenario. I have already returned the mouse and hopefully the Mercury White Edition comes back in stock soon because I'm really hoping to get my hands on it again.. On a side note, people complimented about signing into the Razer software and how they force you to basically hand over your privacy and so on. But, it is not necessary to create an account, unless you really need the two programmable buttons on the side for video games, then I guess you will have to create one.

5,1.0,"This mouse has one major flaw that's an absolute deal breaker - the left/right mouse click triggers are way too sensitive. I never noticed this before, but I like to rest my fingers on the mouse clicks when I'm using my mouse. Most mice need a bit of force before the trigger is clicked, but the Razer mouse only requires a feather light amount of force to trigger the click. This means I can't rest my hand on the mouse while using it.. Absolute deal breaker considering I use my mouse for both working from home 9 hours a day and gaming afterwards. Not being able to rest my hand while using the mouse means my hand gets really cramped after just a few minutes. Your fingers need to be hovering over the mouse in order to prevent accidental clicks. It's fine if you're gaming for short durations, but for 9 hour work days it's a deal breaker.. This isn't my first Razer mouse either, I also have a Razer Mamba but it's wireless and I wanted a wired mouse, it does not suffer from the same overly sensitive mouse triggers. I didn't get another Mamba because the USB cord that comes with it is only 3ft long.

6,3.0,"At approximately $30, I thought that this mouse was well priced; previously, it was selling for $50-60, which I think it too much for it. I would like to point out three features that stand out to me. (1) This mouse is comfortable in the right hand. It is slightly larger than average, which is a good thing. My hands are average, and smaller mice make me feel like I have to pay attention to where they are all the time, or they will disappear. This mouse does not draw undue attention to itself. Importantly, it is sufficiently wide for the thumb and pinky to rest on it comfortably, and it is raised just the right amount under the base of the index finger. This make it easy to hold without having to squeeze, and the hand rests on it comfortably. This helps make the mouse ergonomic and to feel ""organic"" in the hand. These are this mouse's strongest features, in my opinion. (2) The mouse appears to perform quite well in terms of how the pointer motion ""feels"" on the screen. The coordination between the movement of the mouse and the movement of the pointer is flawless. Before this mouse, I had another highly sensitive mouse set up on my computer, and it was not pretty, although adjusting the software settings helped partially. The transition to this mouse felt like a major improvement, and I only had to weak the pointer speed slightly. The pointer movements feel smooth and precise. (3) I wish this mouse were a little heavier. I also wish that the wheel feet a little more substantial. Both the mouse and the wheel require a tiny bit of effort to move, and this is not enough for my comfort. This is especially problematic with the wheel. The finger slides on the wheel without triggering it, requiring mental effort to press on the wheel to turn it, but not too hard to click it. This is a major disadvantages of this mouse. I would say another 20-40 grams of weight to the body of the mouse would have made all the difference. And a slightly more resistant or rubbery wheel would have made a difference. The relatively lightness of the mouse and low resistance of the wheel draw attention to themselves and take away a sensation of substance that I enjoy in a mouse. That being said, the mouse feels more substantial than your average, cheap, smallish, light, plastic mouse. Some users may prefer their mouse on the lighter side, and some users may like a greasy wheel that is hard to rotate, but I do not.",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Mercury White,0.09973544973544973,0.5721428571428572
7,4.0,"I've owned several iterations of the Deathadder before buying the v2 (Pro), and I'm coming most recently from the Elite. For other people like me who are familiar with Razer's lineup and thinking about the v2, I just want to point out some differences that stood out to me about their newest model:. - Loud: Clicking is EXTREMELY loud compared to the Elite. It also has a hollow 'pop' tone compared to the Elite's more solid and consistent tone. I'm not sure if the sound will get quieter over time, but even if it does I doubt it will ever be nearly as quiet as the Elite. The side-buttons are a bit louder than the Elite as well. - Shorter and fatter cable: I'm planning to use the v2 Pro mostly wired, and the new cable is a few feet shorter, plus it has a sheath that makes it look much thicker than the Elite'. - Better side-grips: In the v2, the entire side-panel has a textured grip, rather than just the lower half on the Elite. - Lighter: Even with the wireless tech, the v2 is lighter than the Elite. I used to have a Mamba as my travel-mouse which was significantly heavier than the Elite. It's great to have a travel-mouse that doesn't have a lot more weight to account for the battery. - Better scroll wheel: The scroll wheel is actually quieter than the Elite, but feels mostly the same (maybe 10% smoother, but that could just be from wear-and-tear on my Elite)",Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse: 6400 DPI Optical Sensor - 5 Programmable Buttons - Mechanical Switches - Rubber Side Grips - Mercury White,0.1926677489177489,0.41583694083694084
8,2.0,"The first dumb thing about this mouse is that it requires software to set up and be functional (Razer Synapse). The next even worse thing is that Razer claims it's mac compatible but it's a known issue that they stopped supporting mac several operating system versions ago. So I went through the 30 minute hassle of downloading Synapse, making a Razer account and troubleshooting because the software would not identify the mouse only to read later that mac is no longer supported. Total scam. For those of you who have this mouse already and use mac, I found a lifesaver program called Razer macOS that someone made (it's free, google it) for this exact problem. That will allow you to change DPI and RGB settings but no hotkeys or anything else.

9,5.0,"This is my main. I have the Viper Ultimate and the Viper mini from Razer as well as others from logitech such as the g305, g703 and the model d minus incoming. The Deathadder v2 is the one I perform the best with, no competition.. I play claw and palm/claw with a hand size of 19.1 x 9.9cm and the ergonomics on this thing are hard to get used to, but once you do it's hard to go back to any other shape. I wish there was an EC2 size variant to this because the mini is more like an EC4 and it's too small for me. The DA is slightly on the big side for my grip style but it's still very comfy and lightweight. The side buttons are a little too far forward for me to reliably hit the front side button which is a bummer.. The sensor is flawless and is more reliable than the hero on my G703 which doesn't like a few of my pads (I might've got a defective unit). The clicks are better than the viper ultimate, but not as good as the Viper mini but still good. Optical switches are different but not in a good or bad way just different the pros: they are quick durable and wont double click, the cons: the feedback is different and on the viper ultimate, almost mushy. The side grips are really nice and if you need extra grip try the Razer grips, I highly recommend them. The cable is basically non existent (I have a bungee), i cant feel it. The feet weren't as good as the other new Razers for some reason speed wise. They would also catch my soft pad when swiping left/rear and I count figure out why so I replaced them with tiger arc 2s and they are better for sure.

If its unplugged and cycles through bios I can plug it back in and it will work. This can be fixed though. I have no control over the mouse due to not having the program installed. The mouse out of box has been working fine for me. Its a great mouse besides the bloatware. I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5 if the program worked!. I had high hopes ordering this mouse as its a pretty good mouse overall for FPS gaming. Then you have to download the program to use the lighting and on board key binds.

5,1.0,"The listing clearly reads 'rubberized grips' but on the Essentials there is no rubber grip. There are textured plastic grips, which if you have even a hint of grease, sweat, hand moisturizer, wetness, or anything on your skin it will make moving the mouse a pain in the ass.. It is also clear this mouse was used heavily, as the underside had grime stuck in the area around the optical sensor.. Sadly Amazon does not differentiate the mice listings between versions, so while I gave a 4/5 to the Elite I will override that score to warn people to do fall for the cheap price tag of the Essentials.

6,5.0,"I‚Äôm a bit of a Razer fanboy. I‚Äôve been using the basilisk ultimate, which I love. Before that was the death adder V2 wired. When I saw the V2 DA pro came out, I couldn‚Äôt justify the cost, given I already have the basilisk ultimate. But when the DA pro was on a sale for $79 - it was too good of a deal to pass up. Their mouse has the best feeling mouse clicks that I have felt on any mouse. Also - I didn‚Äôt even realize it had Bluetooth until I turned it over to retrieve the usb dongle from its little compartment - where it still resides. Connected to a Bluetooth 5.0 dongle - this mouse is super accurate. Also - I‚Äôve been using it daily for a week and it is still over 90 percent charged - gotta love BT 5.0. Battery life is significantly better than the Basilisk ultimate using usb dongle. If you are right handed and have a medium-size to large hand - this is the mouse.

7,5.0,"Many of the reviews were obviously written before this product had been improved. Razer really must listen to their consumer because, I see no flaws in this product. For example, there are no rubber strips on the side anymore that ""fall off"" In fact, It is ergonomically excellent and stops hand fatigue, quick as anyone could want for gaming, with reprogrammable buttons. The Synapse program for this device integrates seamlessly and automatically with your Chroma version. Programming the mouse is a breeze. The color of the logo and wheel are a pleasant green which can be turned up or down. If you care about colors matching your keyboard all the time you probably want the v2. But, with my hand over the mouse, I don't see much of the lights anyway. So, for a very low price for a very good mouse, I am very happy. This is an excellent product. I highly recommend it..

8,5.0,"I've upgraded to this after using the Deathadder Elite for about five years. This mouse is almost identical. I was weary because it advertises a new sensor and new switches for the buttons but really, I don't think I can tell any difference. If you need 20K DPI you're crazy. There's no reason to upgrade to this from the Elite. The new feet/skis/pads made a bigger difference than anything. The only reason I bought this was because my Elite M1 and scroll wheel was starting to fail.. Which brings me to my next topic: warranty. I didn't even bother contacting Razer warranty (Who knows... maybe they would have surprised me) and it's no secret that Logitech has a pretty good customer service satisfaction, at least by comparison. Many of the Razer and Logitech mice use the same sensors and thus perform very similar. Even though I find Razer longevity lacking compared to Logitech, I still come back to Razer because I prefer how tracking algorithm works compared to Logitech. That's not to say the tracking on modern Logitech mice are not also fantastic. In most ways, I find it comes personal preference these days. One brand doesn't necessarily have superior tracking over the other, it's just handled slightly differently.

9,4.0,"I saw this on sale compared to it's other variations, and since I have enjoyed my old Razer mouse, a Naga Chroma, I was hoping that this mouse would be RGB too, but I guess I put too much in the way of hope, to sync the colorations to my keyboard, computer, headset, and desk's RGB lighting.... It's a standard green light-up, and it doesn't change, but the ergonomic feel of the mouse is decent so far, I've had it a couple of days as of yet. I assigned the left-side buttons to set the speed control of the DPI, but it's not working too well, like it did on my Razer Naga, which had specifically two buttons FOR the DPI settings. I'm hoping Razer works on fixing it so I can go back to being to switch sensitivity of the DPI for when I'm trying to shoot people in-game between a close range and being able to turn around lightning fast, versus being able to slow down and line up a shot on my target from 300m away.... For standard uses, the mouse works well enough, but again, those two left-side buttons can be... accidentally pressed and ruin a moment, say when you're reading an article or watching something, and BAM!

0,1.0,"Really really disappointed in this mouse - I had to replace it so many times and every single replacement had a different thing wrong with it. Now I feel I can't anymore because I replaced it so many times. For a mouse this expensive, it makes NO sense for it to have this many issues so consistently.. 1st: Squeaky mouse wheel; after a week of use (common complaint of this mouse). 2nd: Bad left click; immediately upon arrival. 3rd: Would hear a click when scrolling; after a week. 4th: Right side creaks when mouse squeezed; immediately upon arrival. I think part of the problem is the light-weight material. It feels great in my hand but there are just way too many issues to justify a good review on this product. I wish I went with a different brand or different model.. /* OLD REVIEW */. This mouse was exactly what I was looking for, but it took 2 replacements to get it right - that's the only reason it gets a 4 not a 5 star. The first mouse came and had a squeaky wheel. The second mouse came with left mouse click issues - slight give before the click. Some users might not notice that but it was annoying for me. I almost gave up and went with a different brand but the click on the first mouse felt great so I tried one more time. The third mouse was perfect.. The grip took a little bit to get used (4 / 5 days) to but feels very natural now and is the perfect size for my hand, average male adult hand.

The scroll mouse is my absolute favorite. And all of the button placements are perfect.. But, I found that when you switch between Windows profiles, the mouse will not allow the profile to fully load. This results in you logging in, but being unable to use the task bar or the windows key. The only reliable way to fix this is to restart the computer. Sometimes more than once. I tried deleting and reinstalling a lot of stuff before determining that it wasn‚Äôt a software conflict. I would guess that it has something to do with how the mouse loads profiles for each user..

4,2.0,"The unit is just built cheap. Not the quality product you expect from a major brand name like Razor. This entry level into the low end market sacrifices quality in too many places ranging from the feel of the plasticky mouse, its weight, and material used on the foot of the mouse. It did come with a nice USB cord, but that was about it.. The reason for the two star review is the scratchy noise coming from the pads on the product which forced me to stop using. A mouse, whether or not it's expensive or in-expensive, need feet that glide smoothly on a mousing surface. This mouse consistently made a noticeable grinding noise across a hard surface mouse pad (steelseries gaming mouse pad), where other mice do not have any issues. I attribute this to part of their material selection and cheaper build which resulted in a poor user experience.. I guess I bought it to ""try"" a Razor mouse.

To clarify, I have not accidentally damaged the mouse in any way. Would NOT recommend.. ---. Everyone knows the Razer Deathadder. It's a chonky boi that fits my large hands and gives me comfort rather than those baby mice of other companies. Nevertheless, they were not without flaws. I am upgrading from a Deathadder Elite after the scroll wheel started to bug out (after 3 years) and it would scroll UP at times when I was scrolling down. The v2 has a number of improvements I think are noticeable.. 1. The side grips are now integrated into the mouse. This is noticeable because on my previous version, it would peel off. Very annoying.. 2. The mouse wheel is more tactile and has definite ""stops"" in its traction. Honestly, I think I prefer the softer feel of the deathadder elite, but this feels more structurally sound.. 3. RBG is brighter. Yay RBG, go knock yourself out. It's actually too bright for me so I had to turn it down.. 4. PEG feet on the bottom are sturdier and glide better. Minor improvement, but still felt I had to mention it.. 5.

6,5.0,"As a person who coveted price over performance for many years, I have owned a plethora or mice in the budget discount market. Feeling that if I spent a third of the price of name brand mice, and still got 2-3 years of use, then I was winning the game so to speak.. After my last mouse started not registering clicks at the most inopportune times, I finally realized that I needed to look at a quality mouse. That's where the Razer Deathadder Essential comes in. What a world of difference!. The Good: Size. It is LARGE. For someone with larger hands, typical mice in the budget category were often just adequate to just a bit too small. The Deathadder fits and feels like a substantial extension of my hand.. Weight. The Deathadder is heavy. Not ridiculous heavy, but heavy enough you feel you are moving something. I happen to love this about the Deathadder. It gives me the weighted feedback that I am moving the mouse in a way that I want, not by accident because it was too light and it lifted and shifted it's position because of a minute twitch of my wrist.. Adjustable: Having multiple dpi and mhz settings allows me to fine tune the Deathadder to suit my use case needs. 5 settings will be all you need to choose what works best for you.. The Bad: Lighting. The single color lighting would be nice if I could adjust that single color to fit the theme of my setup instead of just the Razer Green. If there is a way to change that color in the software, it's well hidden. This is a cosmetic thing and in no way adversely affects the performance of the Deathadder..

The quick DPI change buttons are nice, too. But the problem with this mouse, is you have to install a 490 MB driver and software tool just to change the color. And the tool has to be running all the time to hold that color. If you close the tool, or even just lock your computer, the mouse reverts back to default rainbow-cycling state. So while my computer is locked, everything matches but the mouse. How dumb. And the mouse software prompts for updates and login... Come on, it's a mouse.

8,3.0,"The quality of this mouse (DeathAdder v2) is excellent. It makes quite good inexpensive alternatives like the Redragon Cobra feel like cheap competitors. It glides well on or off a mousepad, and the sensor never glitches. I use this with a mousepad and wrist rest over 8 hours a day, mostly in palm grip, and find the lightness of the mouse to reduce repetitive strain. I can't rate the durability since I've only had this product for a month.. That said, there's an infuriating limitation: customizing the lighting requires the Synapse software to be constantly running in the background. As soon as you exit, the mouse reverts to its distracting default of cycling through a rainbow of colors. Razer customer service confirms this. I just want the mouse to stay red!.

0,5.0,"Like a lot of folks, I have young kids (8 and 6) doing virtual classrooms right now. They did not use PC's a lot before COVID, and I wanted to give them the best possible experience to help keep them motivated. I'll say this right now - both kids loved it. They liked how easily it glides, the weight, the size and - of course - the fact that it can light up. They aren't competitive gamers so we're not using the included grip stickers.. One interesting feature was that one kid likes to keep the logo one color and the other likes the colors to change - and with the Razer Synapse3 software, both can be accommodated. If you are working with kids you will want to change the DPI settings to just 1 or 2 settings though (from the default 5)... 6400-DPI and kids are not compatible.. Versus the previous standard/basic optical mice, the difference was noticeable even for the kids. The mouse is lighter, glides more easily, and is more comfortable for their hands. Lighting and DPI changing capabilities are bonuses.. From the perspective of the adult.... I've used a full-size Razer DeathAdder on my desktop for a few years now, so I feel like I can give a pretty good comparison of the full-size versus the mini. In short, the mini really is just a smaller DeathAdder in terms of feel with just 2 changes.. The first (and smallest) change is that the scroll-wheel trim does not light up like it does on the full size (the logo still glows though).. The second change is the DPI-shifting button... singular. The full-size has two buttons - DPI-up and DPI-down; the mini has just one that scrolls up to max then restarts at the bottom. Having to scroll through the whole way would be detrimental in some fast-action gaming situations, but as people generally leave DPI static after starting a game it's probably minimal. Otherwise, the button feels a tad cheaper than the ones on the full-size, but I don't think it's functional... it's probably just a larger physical pad mounted on the same switches. Since the DPI-shifter is by far the least-used button, I think this is OK..

Light, but heavy enough so it doesn‚Äôt lift up while gaming. The whole mouse is extremely well designed with buttons that are placed ergonomically for a more comfortable and efficient play. The mouse has good rgb and has a nice and subtle click. The best part in my opinion is the response time and braided cable. It has a similar actuation design as the huntsman elite keyboard (I also have that and love it) which makes it lighting quick to commands.

3,5.0,"My previous Razer DeathAdder died, so I ordered a replacement. The v2 has the same comfortable size, weight, and (right-handed) grip of the previous model. The mouse is a little on the large side, meaning I can rest almost my entire hand on the mouse comfortably. The two teflon pads on the bottom of the mouse are generously sized compared to the three tiny pads on some other mice.. The 20,000 DPI sensor is much more sensitive than I'm used to. However, using all of those 20,000 DPI seems to require that you install the Razer Synapse software, since the stock profiles only go up to 3,200 DPI. With the software, you can customize sensitivity profiles easily.. The v2 advertises eight total programmable buttons. One of those buttons is a profile control on the underside of the mouse, and two are dynamic sensitivity adjusters under the scroll wheel. The sensitivity adjusters can be rebound to different functions, but Synapse only supports button numbers up to 5, so if you want to customize buttons 6 and 7 then you'll need to bind them to a macro, text, or other advanced function. The two thumb buttons are comfortable to use. Clicking down the scroll wheel requires a little more force than I'd like, but the ""click"" isn't mushy the way many scroll wheels often are.. The LED lighting on the Razer logo and scroll wheel is full-RGB, rather than the green-only of the previous model. It's highly customizable in software as well..

Switched to a wireless Logitech mouse after a little while of not gaming, which only lasted about 3 months before the laser started messing up. Went back to Razer and bought this and have no idea why I ever strayed away.. Pros:. -Grippy surfaces where they should be. -great feeling buttons. -good weight.

5,4.0,"Ive had the mouse for 2 months now and this is probably the most comfortable mouse in my hand that I have ever bought. The soft but hard texture of the mouse is amazing. Combine that with how your fingers feel encompassed by the buttons with the ergonomic design and it makes for a very enjoyable experience. When I lay my hand on the mouse it feels natural, and apart of my hand, instead of my hand just simply laying on top of it, if that makes sense. And the RGB on the mouse is dope, and in moderation. Top that off with a 50$ price point and I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.. I take away 1 star for 4 small reasons that are not deal breakers, but could use some improvement or just things I dont prefer.. 1. The 2 buttons for the thumb are too far foward. Instead of my thumb resting in the middle of the 2 buttons making it easy to hit either one, my thumb rests on the center of the button closest to me forcing me to have to stretch my thumb up to the front of 2 the buttoms. Ive gotten used to it now, and it may not be an issue for some, but its something to keep in mind. Also I have big hands, Im a 300lb male (I use this account for prime) and im 6'4 so it isnt a ""small hands"" issue the buttons are just legitly too far forward.. 2. There is a slight deadzone when you left click. Not sure if this is really a con, as I believe it has helped me with miss clicking less. However I do prefer an immediate click with no give in the button. None the less it was nothing to get used to it and now I dont even notice it. In fact, it could have even been a calculated design to help with miss clicking since the button itself doesnt need much force to activate a click. Either way, it took some getting used too and is not what I prefer, but its still good.. 3. The scroll wheel is not great. This doesnt mean much as most mice I have had didnt have a great scroll wheel. It just feels... cheap and doesnt always like to ""lock in"" to place sometimes if you are lightly scrolling on the wheel. Not a major deal though as I said most mice Ive had didnt have great scroll wheels.. 4. Most mice have a ""sound"" to them while clicking. This mouse sound a bit hollow. When you click it sounds like it resonates in the body of the mouse. I came from a Logitec g203 prodigy mouse and the sound of that mouse made the mouse sound well built, not hollow. Again this is not a deal breaker nor a major issue but it is something to keep in mind.. Pros:. - Most comfortable mouse in my hand I have ever owned. - Very accurate and amazing for gaming. - I got it for 49.99 so it was a great deal for such a comfortable, accurate mouse. - +200fps because the mouse has RGB :). Cons:. - Thumb mouse buttons are a bit too far forward on the mouse. - Very slight ""deadzone"" when left clicking but nothing serious or anything to worry about. - The ""sound"" of the mouse/clicks sound hollow. Makes the mouse ""sound"" cheaper.

6,1.0,"(TLDR at bottom). Pictured is my new mouse (already wrapped up ready to be sent back) next to my old mouse (broken scroll wheel and I'm still choosing it over the razor mouse). Deathadder v2 is significantly larger than the Logitech G302 yet the G302 weighs 1.5Xs more. Deathadder honestly feels like I could crush it in my hand. Feels incredibly cheap, and was awful to try and use in terms of control on screen as well. The back angles down so steep I would honestly rate it a 0 for ergonomic. Your hand wants to naturally slide off the back of the mouse rather than rest on top. Its WAY more effort than it should be to keep ahold of this mouse.

3,3.0,"Whats not to like? You get 4 batteries with a 4 battery charger that can easily grant you 40+ hours of playtime. Its a bonus that they fit the stock controller backing. There has been so many times in the past in which I have misplaced my stock controller back due to having to use a 3rd party back to fit their weird battery packs. This remedies that issue and does a good job doing so. The battery charger also clearly shows you via indicator lights which batteries are charged. WIN WIN. I would recommend these batteries over any other 3rd party brand. 4 for the price of 2!. Update:. These batteries do NOT last nearly as long as the OE batteries nor regular AA batteries. Also, often times you will not be notified that the batteries are about to die and they will die abruptly. This is a no go if you play online FPS games or pretty much any online game that cannot be paused while you figure your battery situation out.

As for drawbacks; you won't want o leave the battery charger plugged in all the time if you have you're gaming set up in you're bedroom and like all of you're lights off because it always has some sort of light emitting from it.

6,5.0,"Works as expected. So far, the battery life has been more than sufficient for the amount I play. My sessions usually lasts for an hour or two and I've gone 3 or 4 sessions before getting a low battery notification. Lately I've been in the habit of swapping in a fresh pack at the start of each session just to assure I won't be interrupted mid-game. There are a lot of reviews of people saying they don't fit but that is because they aren't putting them in correctly. They are a little tricky but absolutely fit. You need to insert at a specific orientation which makes total sense but also need to insert the contact side first before pushing down the non-contact side. (See photos) This can be a little annoying when you are trying to switch the packs out quickly but once you get the hang of it it really isn't a big deal. I've confirmed they fit in both standard xbox1 as well as elite controller. The charger itself is solid and feels like it's good quality. Green/red glow adds a cool lighting effect. Got this for xmas so will try to remember to update after 6mo or so to attest to the staying power of the charge.","Rechargeable Battery Packs for Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, 4 X 1200mAh Xbox One Controller Battery Packs, Rechargeable Batteries with Charging Station for Xbox One/One S/One X/One Elite",0.08969907407407407,0.46238425925925924
7,5.0,"My ONLY complaint is no 2.0 Amp wall adapter. The included power cable is 2.0 Amp capable, but is short.. The batteries seem solidly constructed and hold a charge well. The batteries are engineered to fit into the controllers only in proper orientation. Although the dock is also constructed to fit in proper orientation, the battery can be forced in the wrong direction or simply inserted upside down. The upside-down battery registers as being charged, which is actually great, because we put them in upside down to indicate they are ready to go and prevents recharge fatigue and wasted electricity.. The red/green indicators can NOT be missed and are intuitive. When everything is fully charged, the electric cable can simply be unplugged from the dock side, to save electricity and to turn the lights off.. Because we have and use 4 controllers, I purchased two of these chargers, so no matter how many people are playing, there is always a fresh battery available. This also addresses the issue of dock-style chargers being unable to charge batteries not in a controller, dock pins getting bent, and poorly-fitting controllers.

And for my Xbox Series X controller, it will notify me of low batteries then completely die within 5 minutes, unlike other batteries that usually notify you with half hour life remaining.

9,4.0,"Positives:. Product fits well into controller, snaps in place, obvious if it's installed incorrectly (because it will feel like it needs to be forced), charge station similarly, batteries obviously fit in one correct orientation, makes it easier to use for kids or in dark environments. Charge station changes colors between Red (Charging) and Green (Ready), making it easy to tell which packs are good to go when you need to swap.. Charge station uses a standard USB, convenient to plug into the xbox itself.. Negatives:. Each rechargeable on this product is a replacement for both batteries inside a controller (so this covers up to 4 controllers). However, the rated mAh on each pack (1200) is *less* - basically half of a single standard copper-top rechargable AA (2500), so you will get about a quarter of the total playtime compared to just using AAs.. It may reach 10 without a headset plugged into the controller, in my experience I get around 6.. If you do get this product I'd buy enough to have two packs for each controller, since they will need to be swapped frequently - perhaps as often as every day if you have a lot of players or play for long sessions.","Rechargeable Battery Packs for Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, 4 X 1200mAh Xbox One Controller Battery Packs, Rechargeable Batteries with Charging Station for Xbox One/One S/One X/One Elite",0.038345864661654135,0.343734335839599

1,5.0,"I just recently got the Xbox Series X and I knew that I needed a good charger and this was just what the doctor ordered. I plan on using it with the Carbon Black, Robot White, and Shock Blue Controllers I have now and the Pulse Red controller once it drops next month. In terms of what I really like about it for one I like that it charges up to four batteries simultaneously. Another thing and I would probably say this is the best thing that the batteries charge rather quickly so that‚Äôs always good when you wanna get back into the action and lastly I would say another thing I like about it is you don‚Äôt have to use replacement battery doors on the back of your controller I know for some who like to buy rechargeable battery packs they may not mind it because the back of the controller really isn‚Äôt something that most people will focus on but especially if in the rare instance you have a controller that has unique artwork or something of that nature on the battery door at least now you don‚Äôt have to swap it I would definitely recommend this to anyone who owns an Xbox One or an Xbox Series X/S.","Rechargeable Battery Packs for Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, 4 X 1200mAh Xbox One Controller Battery Packs, Rechargeable Batteries with Charging Station for Xbox One/One S/One X/One Elite",0.17137681159420293,0.332608695652174
2,5.0,"Base charger and 4 batteries. Works like a charm out of the box. Shown as advertised. Depending on how you are you'll either love the brightness or hate it. It is extremely bright when green and I would recommend it not be in your direct line of sight while gaming. It's not overly large and can be placed easily anywhere with its USB cable and charger. Batteries fit easily into any Xbox controller. Have tried on Elite gen 1 controller and standard Xbox1 controllers. No issues. Holds a great charge. Batteries have a large nib side and small nib side. This to make sure you use correct batteries with your controller as shown in photo of battery insert for controller. I saw a previous review complaining these would not fit controller. These should work for any Xbox one official controller.. Update: So here's an update after using for almost a year. 2 of the 4 batteries now no longer hold a good charge. No matter how long I let them sit; 1-3 days of charge, they die out within 30 min. It's not a major loss but still kinda disappointing. I probably wouldn't buy another set again as I have another battery set that I've had over 2 yrs with no issues or charge loss. So if you don't mind it, buy it just be aware of this issue. I've revised my original 5-star rating down to 3-stars.","Rechargeable Battery Packs for Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, 4 X 1200mAh Xbox One Controller Battery Packs, Rechargeable Batteries with Charging Station for Xbox One/One S/One X/One Elite",0.09861524470899473,0.5424272486772487

My only complaint is that with light use of just using controller for HBO Max, netflix, etc, the batteries seem to die way quicker than previous rechargables. Not that big of deal since there is 4 of them, should always have a charged battery, yet when they start going down they die pretty quick. My suggestion if you're gaming, as soon as it shows low battery swap as soon as you can!

After my initial review I was promptly contacted by a service rep who offered refund or replace. I received a replacement and am currently testing them. Standby. So far so good after about a week now.. original review:. Recharging constantly, so glad there is 4. Lucky to get 2-3 hours per battery per charge and it says 15.

The battery life does not last long at all in my Xbox One Series X controller. I let them charge the way the instruction says, with vibration off, I get 45 minutes to 1 hour of battery life. My rechargeable energizers did a better job, however.

If there's more than two gamers in your house and you plan to game all day you're going to run out of batteries though.. My only real complaint is the lights on the base. While charging, the light around the battery charging port is red. Once it's fully charged, it's green. If a port is empty, it's also green. And the lights shine from the open hole like a lighthouse in the dark. I could probably direct airplanes at night with it. So if you're getting these for your bedroom and you need it dark to sleep, keep that in mind.","Rechargeable Battery Packs for Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, 4 X 1200mAh Xbox One Controller Battery Packs, Rechargeable Batteries with Charging Station for Xbox One/One S/One X/One Elite",-0.045555555555555544,0.5481481481481482
9,5.0,"I bought these after comparison shopping with some others that were just one battery for about the same price. My Xbox Series controller is a battery hog and could sometimes go through a non-rechargeable battery in a day or two of heavy use. These last up to a day of similar use, but chances are I have to swap out about once per day on average. Having 4 packs in this, there are usually 3 packs charged and ready to go. Inserting them into the controller takes a little getting used to at first - they only go in one way - but now I can do it easily enough. If you've got multiple controllers and players around, this would be a handy set. Note: only a short USB cable is supplied, not a a charging block. Or, you can have it charge it from your console, which is what I did. Overll, it does the job for a reasonable price.","Rechargeable Battery Packs for Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, 4 X 1200mAh Xbox One Controller Battery Packs, Rechargeable Batteries with Charging Station for Xbox One/One S/One X/One Elite",0.028906250000000005,0.4609375
0,3.0,"First off, I want to address something I've seen in many of the reviews for this product. They absolutely DO fit in the Xbox Series X/S controllers. They only fit one way, and they certainly doesn't look like they will fit, but they DO fit. It would have been helpful if they had provided a picture of how they are supposed to be inserted, because it is unintuitive. Once you know the correct way to do it, they are easy to get in and out.. Battery life (when they were new, anyway) ran around 8-10 hours, which is much less than regular batteries, but not horrible for the price, and given that this package includes 4 of them. The problem is, after 6 months of usage, they no longer charge AT ALL. I put them in the charger, the lights turn red (indicating that they are charging), then within minutes it turns green (so it has stopped charging). At best, I can get about 5 minutes out of them, but mostly they won't even power on the controller any more.. So, my advice is to spend a bit more and get some decent rechargeables.","Rechargeable Battery Packs for Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, 4 X 1200mAh Xbox One Controller Battery Packs, Rechargeable Batteries with Charging Station for Xbox One/One S/One X/One Elite",0.2966991341991342,0.46014485514485504

I dont controller game to often but ive had no issues with battery life so far! Ive probably put around 8 hours into one pack and my controller never turned off (I could not tell you the actually battery life time because i've swapped them out before they died).. -The only issue ive had is the when your batteries are out of the charging station, the light still glows green, and when its glowing there is a faint dimming/flashing that happens. When youre gaming or not really looking at it you dont notice it. But obviously when youre looking at it, you notice it. But it is very faint!. -Id rate this 4.5 out of 5 if I could.

Honestly it's ridiculous xbox forces us to have to buy separate batteries for a controller to work in 2021....EVERY controller should just come with a simple USB to charge it not batteries you have invest money in every couple of months. Thought I would be able to just buy these and be done with it but even upon reading more reviews I see that they typically stop working after 4-6months and with it already dying at 50% I do not doubt this.

2,5.0,"This review is for the new ""Shock Blue"" variant of the Xbox controller that launched alongside the Xbox Series X/S.. Aesthetically, I love the blue color and white back. This is a good looking controller. But let's be honest, you barely will look at it once you start gaming, so.... Xbox controllers have not changed much since the days of the Xbox 360. They have instead gone through minor iterational improvements, and that is no different here. This new controller looks and functions nearly the same as the Xbox One controller, other than the new ""Share"" button in the middle and a switch from micro-USB to USB-C. It still has the 3.5mm headset jack, accessory port for keypads and older headsets, and runs on AA batteries.. The main differences are the feel of the controller itself and the D-pad. It now has a lot more textured feeling, which extends to the bumpers and triggers. The bumpers used to be glossy and slippery and now they're more of a matte finish. The D-pad returns to the more ""paddle"" like one from the Xbox 360 but is much improved from that version and feels tight and clicky instead of wobbly. It's similar to the paddle D-pad on the Elite Series 2, if you've seen those. The controller also feels ever so slightly smaller in the hand. Just barely, but something about it feels just a smidge different than the previous generation. The Share button also makes it easier to save gameplay clips and whatnot as well, it's essentially just a shortcut from pressing the Xbox button and manually navigating to share settings.. This thing works with all Xbox One/S/X consoles and Xbox Series X/S, as well as PC and bluetooth devices. So it has a lot of versatility. It works great out of the box and I adjusted to it right away coming from Xbox One controllers. Again, it's barely different, so when I say adjusted to it, I basically just mean I switched to it and that was it!. I'm an Xbox fan and I love the controller. In my opinion it is nearly perfect, however I have yet to experience the PS5's haptics, which sound interesting. I have no problem with the AA batteries as they last a long time and you don't need to worry about aging internal batteries. That being said, if you've had issues with Xbox controllers in the past, this iteration will not change your mind.",Xbox Core Controller - Carbon Black,0.16086687053256818,0.37610616128057983

4,4.0,"It's a slight revision to the Xbox family of controllers, so nothing groundbreaking here. The texture on the grips is pleasant, and most everything feels good. While I would have preferred a built-in battery, the battery life seems really good with rechargeable batteries. My biggest complaint stems from the very clicky d-pad. It works well enough, but it's very loud.. Also, if you're buying this for a PC, note that this caused a lot of frustration to get working with my PC initially. I had to do a firmware upgrade to the controller (no cable included), and I had to do a system update on Windows, but an issue with SSD compatibility initially prevented me from getting the latest version. Apparently my Bluetooth adapter, which I had used in the past with the Switch Pro and DS4 controllers, was dying.

I like the new controller- the textured back feels great on the hands, the d-pad and the shoulder bumpers are clicky in all the ways I like, and they feel nice in my wide palmed, short fingered lady hands. When using the official Wireless Adapter (not bootlegged, link below) it connected easily to my Windows 10 machine. However, therein lies the problem: you need to spend the extra /$25/, on top of the $60 price for the controller, to connect it to a non-bluetooth PC.. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZB7W4QU. IMO a wired USB cable should've been packed with the controller at the very least. The controller is great, but the $85 price tag (for PC users) really hurts.

6,5.0,"I like all the changes they made to the new controller. This review is by a PC gamer, I've never actually had an Xbox.. -The triggers are a matte hard rubber black texture with small bumps. They are much easier to press down and the texture feels way better. The One X had weird slippery plastic bumpers and triggers that made games that use the bumpers a lot (for example, Dark Souls) a bit less comfortable than a PS controller. The bumper feedback is much more of a deep bump than the plasticy click of the old controller and I like it.. -The grips have a micro-texture as well which makes that controller less slippery in that aspect as well.. -The circular directional pad with raised arrows are very clicky, much louder than the One X directional cross. Most games just use the directional buttons for activating items, menus, etc. However I am not much of a fighting game player so I would read other reviews who might have stronger feelings about this change.. -Type-C cable instead of micro-USB. That means faster charging if you buy the optional rechargeable battery pack.. -The controller is a tiny bit heavier, and feels solid. My old One X controller squeeks and crackles a little bit if I squeeze the controller, the Series X makes no audible noise from strongly squeezing the grips. I would say the build quality got an upgrade, but we will have to see if that lasts with age/use.. So yeah, i'd say it's a straight upgrade, but it's not so different that you need to rush out and buy a new one right away.. ****Weird note! For whatever reason the controller had all kinds of small dust particles on the outside, fresh from the sealed box. I don't know why that was, but it came right off so it might just be a warehouse thing.",Xbox Core Controller - Carbon Black,0.025480187980187977,0.400975000975001

9,5.0,"I haven't owned an Xbox since the 360, but I had been using the USB 360 controller for PC gaming since then. That controller recently gave out on me when the connection between the cord and the controller failed. I was then using a PS4 controller to hold me over until this controller came out. The PS4 controller works OK, but I never liked micro USB connectors. The connector on the PS4 controller also started to fail, so it disconnected easily when I moved. It also doesn't have Xinput (Microsoft's controller API) support like the Xbox controllers do. Because of Xinput, most games are automatically configured correctly to recognize the Xbox controller (any of them, not just this model), so I couldn't wait to get back to an Xbox controller.. Another (maybe weird?) thing about me is that I don't like wireless controllers. It's annoying to change or recharge batteries when the controller just permanently sits within wired distance of my PC anyway. I've had wireless controllers in the past that I couldn't use without the battery pack inserted, but this one works great with just a USB cable and no batteries. I also like the fact that it uses regular AA batteries, and not a proprietary battery pack. I also love the USB-C connector and have been eagerly waiting for more controllers to have them. USB-C feels less prone to failure than micro USB.. These may be strange things to talk about as opposed to how the controller actually feels, but most people already know what to expect from an Xbox controller as it hasn't changed that much. I wanted to add a few points that stood out to me personally. It would have been nice for them to throw in a USB-C cable, but other than that I love everything about it so far.",Xbox Core Controller - Carbon Black,0.05277777777777778,0.4537749287749287

2,5.0,"2020 has been a year chock full o‚Äô disappointment, chaos & being tethered to the home which means more time planted on the sofa, like a bump on a log, grinding out time by playing video games & having the controllers get wonky in record time. I wasn‚Äôt looking to buy the newer model controllers & simply wanted to replace the original style, but as they‚Äôre apparently discontinued, I‚Äôm darned glad I did, as they are seemingly more comfortable & responsive. After shelling out just $10 less than what I paid for this one for a refurbished controller from GameStop (who are using trash tier parts to fix the exchanged ones), I found myself having to get this new model. I like using a Kontrol Freek Extender on the R thumbstick & a concave silicone cover on the L, but w/ the refurbished ones, they‚Äôre using thumstick replacements that are just a millimeter or 2 too small for the KF extenders & silicone covers. Without any thumbstick extender/cover, GS‚Äôs cheapo replacements just feel weird & made game play awful. Don‚Äôt get me started on how bad the buttons were as it‚Äôs infuriating enough to make you want to punch puppies! This new controller, as I said, is crazy comfortable & I swear the buttons respond better. The sharing button is pretty helpful too & as everyone & their mother is uploading videos or streaming their gameplay, it‚Äôs a right handy little addition. I‚Äôve only used this for a few games, mostly for RDR2, but it definitely helped me to have that better, more comfy feel & responsiveness.. Now for the downside: the Xbox ‚Äúbrand‚Äù & ‚Äúoff brand‚Äù rechargeable batteries are NOT working in it for me. To charge & connect these new controllers, you must have the newest USB-C cords! (Plenty of good deals are to be had here on Amazon for them. I got 2 10‚Äô, gold plated cords for $10) So that I am not ripping through conventional AA batteries, I have my USB-C cord plugged into a charger next to my couch. While I‚Äôm guessing Xbox is either needing to do some sort of update to make the old rechargeable batteries work in these, I‚Äôd bet dollars to doughnuts that they‚Äôre going to put out a new battery & cord combo for these. If you absolutely abhor using cords but don‚Äôt want to rip through batteries, invest in rechargeable AA ones until they sort out why the rechargeable battery packs aren‚Äôt working or come out w/ new ones. To make sure it wasn‚Äôt just my getting a faulty controller, a friend had also gotten one of these & have the same problem w/ not having the Xbox One rechargeable battery pack work in theirs. Aside from this, I can find nothing else negative about these & if you‚Äôre another ‚Äúgrinder‚Äù needing an upgrade to a controller that has drifting & having to mash the buttons to have them register, or a trigger or bumped button went on the wonk; I‚Äôm assured in my telling you to invest in one of these. I‚Äôm hoping the USB-C cord won‚Äôt develop the loosening up that the original micro-USB cords are notorious for.. For those looking for a TL; DR version of my endless drivel, these new controllers are:. More comfortable. More responsive. Need a USB-C cord. Don‚Äôt work w/ Xbox nor offbrand rechargeable battery packs so get rechargeable AA batteries if you don‚Äôt want to be tethered.",Xbox Core Controller - Carbon Black,0.08531926406926406,0.561489898989899

Every other xbox controller has failed me after a year or so and of course they don't replace them under warranty.. My reason for 3/5 stars is because most of the buttons are unnecessarily loud. YXBA buttons and the D-pad are just really annoying. I don't understand why they would do this. The feedback is good but all the clicking is just a huge turnoff. Playing RDR2 for example, when you have to constantly tap A to ride your horse gets old after a while and it's even worse with a loud button..

The New Textures Feel Amazing as this thing really is so premium feeling in every meaningful way as the only thing I would‚Äôve like too see was for Microsoft to have included two back buttons similar to the ones on the cheaper power a 3rd party controllers as it feels so natural to use the back buttons instead of the top Rb / Lb buttons as that‚Äôs the single complaint I have which i think Microsoft could‚Äôve done because the cheaper power a pads have those two buttons, and it makes playing game‚Äôs so much easier, however maybe Microsoft didn‚Äôt wanna cannibalize sales of their Elite V2 which could explain the lack of back buttons on the standard Series X controller but regardless it should‚Äôve had those, and it would be absolutely Perfect !. Also The Shock Blue looks so amazing in person as it‚Äôs much better than the pictures portray as ya gotta have it in order to really appreciate it. Fyi,. The Regular Xbox One Controllers always felt very cheap as they didn‚Äôt feel as though the quality was high at all, and the thumb stick modules were cheap plastic which caused so many broken thumb sticks, and or thumb stick drift, etc as they was terrible, and so that makes Me appreciate the Higher Quality Feel of The New Series X/S controllers even more as they‚Äôre Awesome",Xbox Core Controller - Carbon Black,0.14699989932548074,0.4428646160041508

Pros:. - The Xbox controller design and layout. It's still as great as ever.. - The redesigned D-pad is easier to use.. - The controller is a tiny bit smaller and feels much better sized in my hands.. - They replaced the shiny black texture on the bumpers and triggers with a better matte texture.. - The menu buttons feel more clicky and are more responsive.. Cons:. - Controls are straight up broken in some games when the controller is connected through Bluetooth. They get all jumbled up, like A becomes X, B becomes A, and RT becomes the start button. It works normally when connected through a cable or the Xbox Wireless Adapter. I don't know what the problem is, but they need to fix this ASAP. It's been a while since release and there still has been no recognition of this problem.. - You need to update the firmware to use it on Bluetooth.

6,1.0,"It's official: Microsoft has ruined and/or killed the xbox controller. This is my 2nd controller I've purchased in 2 months. Even though this is my first day using it, and it is in fact brand new, I can already tell it will suffer the same problem as my other two xbox one (usb type c) controllers. There is a small foam strip about half an inch in size that is cheaply glued underneath the Right Trigger in order to help ""dampen"" the trigger pull and prevent the trigger mechanism from hitting the plastic and prevent noise. It took all but 3 weeks for that strip to eventually semi-rip off and fall into my hand while playing a game. My previous controller took 2 months. I give this one a month as well, considering it already feels like the pad is coming off.. Is there a remedy? Yes. But, guess what? Microsoft made these newer controllers much harder to open up, unlike the xbox 360 controller. Now instead of removing a couple of screws with a very common inexpensive tip, you have to essentially almost break your controller case open via prying it open. Then pray you don't break anything inside. Then you need to remove whats left of the foam and vigorously clean the glue off. While that worked for my previous controller, the left joystick started having registration issues a week later making it unusable for either single player or multiplayer games.. The only game I use this for is Rocket League on PC, and when this controller starts having issues like the ones stated then it is unusable. The build quality of these newer controllers is abysmal and it's actually insane that this is Microsofts standard for quality now.

NOW TO THE REVIEW:. As I opened the box and held the controller into my hands for the first time I was already hooked. The older xbox controllers were great, but they added a few improvements that makes the series X/S controller better.. The controller feels much better in the hands since it's a tiny bit smaller than it's predecessors. There's now a share button that gives you the option to record gameplay and take screenshots with just a single button press. The hybrid directional pad fells so nice when you press on it due to it's louder clicky sounds that it makes while gaming. I just love the strong feedback that it gives which you can hear and feel. The textured grips along the controller's side handles and triggers makes the experience just even better. This is just a fantastic comfortable controller to hold while your playing games on your TV screen, computer monitor, or phone screen with a gaming clip as your playing thru the Xbox Game Pass application.. Overall, the new xbox series X/S controller is a nice improvement than it's older counterparts without Microsoft ruining anything from it, but has added some tweaks to the controller that the user would love. üëå",Xbox Core Controller - Carbon Black,0.2726414390207494,0.5499788525650594
1,5.0,"(Note* ordered controller for use on PC. I do not own an Xbox). Just received mine today. I will update how well it holds up at a later time. My previous Xbox One controller (Model 1537, Non-Bluetooth) had an unresponsive Right Bumper (heard that's a common issue). I thought the texturing of the controller was going to be a gimmick, but it is actually one of my favorite aspects. The d-pad is improved and I am personally in favor of it being more tactile and clicky. While I don't usually game on my phone, I still think it is an added plus that I can since my previous controller lacked Bluetooth.

0,5.0,"Although there's been a lot of buzz (and rightfully so) around the new Dualsense PS5 controller, Microsoft decided to take a very different approach from Sony; meaningful, iterative improvements to an already solid base. The first version I ever used, model 1697, was the best controller I had ever used up to that point. It was the primary reason I switched from my XB360, as I was unable to pair it with the console, but the controller was too good to go back. Clicky, responsive buttons, lighter weight, easily accessible battery door, good battery life, solid accuracy and excellent haptic feedback in the triggers made me fall in love. Jump to the next model, the 1708, and all those things remained, but there was a different finish and now the awesome addition of Bluetooth. This has been the controller I've used on console and PC for the better part of 5 straight years. I've even tried to pair it with a couple Sony systems to experience some of the better games exclusive to that platform (I was unsuccessful BTW). Now, introduce this model, the 1914, and I feel like it's 2 steps forward and a step backwards. The D-Pad is outrageously good and responsive, the trigger texturing gives a more involved feel, the matte finish makes it less vulnerable to oils or greases making it slippery and the battery door redesign is a very slight but meaningful touch. Even the added feature of showing the battery level on PC is a tiny detail that shows the thoughtfulness that went into crafting this. The only reason this is not a 5 is the connectivity. Full disclosure, this is primarily used with a PC in this use case, and as such, you WILL need the XBox accessories app, as I needed to apply an update fresh out the box. The Bluetooth connection on my 1708 literally never dropped out in my entire memory of use. Extremely strong, very dependable and no lag to speak of. The 1914, not so much. There's been no observable lag, and when it works, it's easily better, but the connection is very spotty. As mentioned, an update was necessary right out of the box, and performance marginally improved, but as it stands, during a 3 hr play session last night it lost connection at least 10 times, with the Xbox light blinking a few times and going solid again roughly every 20 mins or so. I tried multiple games, including very tight shooters and it's the same thing; excellent performance when it's working, a temporary drop for no more than 5 seconds, then back to working as if nothing happened. I've already gone the driver route of making sure everything is updated correctly, but this seems to be more a 1914 problem, as the 1708 has never had this problem with a console or 3 different PCs with 3 different Bluetooth adapters. Funny though, a wireless adapter is available, and is touted as the primary way to connect without a USB cable (the USB cable does work flawlessly BTW). Of course, there is a fee for this adapter, which makes me feel like this is the classic create a problem, sell the solution sort of scenario, which has soured my experience greatly here. This is a relatively new device, having only been on the market for a little over a month at the time of this writing, so it's definitely possible for this issue to be resolved, but there's currently no discount for this unit, so you're being asked the complete price for an incomplete experience for the time being. Once (if) this issue is resolved, I will absolutely change this to a 5, but right now, with the drops, it's a mediocre purchase at best, with the 1708 currently being a better option, and at a lesser price. Best of luck.. Edit: In order to have the update applied, you must FIRST connect to the PC with your USB-C and use the Xbox accessories app to update, then, most importantly, you must UNPAIR the controller if it was previously paired. If it's the first time pairing, it won't be an issue, but if you previously were paired before the update, it will not apply. After following these steps, I can confidently report all connection issues have been fixed, and there have been no Bluetooth drops to speak of. This is now a 5 star device.",Xbox Core Controller - Carbon Black,0.20889598091302633,0.48821026826708636
1,4.0,"I dont have an Xbox Series X yet but i did need a new controller for my PC so I got one of these to kind of future proof myself and have the extra controller.. Its got nice feedback meaning the clicks of the buttons especially the bumpers are a bit more satisfying than the previous xbox one model. Its weighted a little better. A bit more balanced which should lead to less drops, which is good because I kept destroying my bumper buttons when the old controllers dropped.. It doesnt connect with my windows 10 PC via bluetooth as smoothly as the xbox one version of the controller does. And yes I updated it first by plugging it in. And no it doesnt come with a cable so if youre using it for PC and dont have a USB A to USB C cable youll need one. And i mean need. Because even after the firmware update connectivity is a little fussy I cant imagine what its like without it.. It doesnt quite ""plug and play"" intuitively like the previous model does with PC. The last one i just plugged it in once to update the firmware, had it paired via bluetooth, and never had a problem. With this one I get random (albeit brief) disconnects or other random problems. For instance when I was playing Madden earlier the game thought I had two controllers plugged in (yes I removed all controllers from my PC via bluetooth) which prevented me from playing my franchise mode properly. Nothing a quick restart couldnt fix but... i never had to restart my computer because the xbox one controller had issues.. If i had to do it all over again I would have bought the xbox one version. For one it works better with PC which is what im using it for and also it comes with a cable which this does not. I see people bagging on the replaceable battery being a problem instead of an internal one. I cant say I disagree but i have about 20 rechargable AAs running through my household at any time so this is zero problem for me.

7,4.0,"This is a very nice upgrade from the original xbox one controller.. - If you connect this to your PC via a Bluetooth adapter you can actually run this while plugged into a wall. As far as I know this was not the case with the original controller as I've tried it before. So I can have this plugged into my phone charger without batteries and it will still be connected to my pc.. Pros:. - The texture on the back and sides is very nice, it really grips your heands.. - Even though it's all plastic, it feels very nice to the touch.. - USB Type C finally.. - The shape of the DPad makes it very easy to recognize what direction you are pressing and the tactile feedback makes it easy to know when you've pressed it, more on that later.. - The triggers are shorter and less curved so it fits my large hands better.. And all the other pros of the original xbox one controller.. Cons:. - The grips on the trigger feel very nice, but I'm not sure they are useful, my fingers can still slide off them every now and then.. - While the shape of the DPad is nice, the tactile click is not. It's way too loud and just not satisfying to press. It's so loud I can hear it over the fan in my room, through my noise cancelling Corsair headset while it's underneath my desk. The noise just feels cheap.. - This is minor but the analog triggers need to be pressed down more to get the same result as the original controller. It's most noticeable in Forza Horizon 4. In order to rev to 5000rpm on a car I need to press it down like 90% of the way.

2,5.0,"The controller feels much nicer than the DualShock 4. It‚Äôs bigger, so it will also be a nice change for people with bigger hands.. The textured back of the controller has nice implemented details for Sony fans. If you look close enough, it is composed of the face buttons. The shoulder buttons also protrude more than the DualShock 4. The triggers at stock have a very nice smooth pull with some resistance. It will be nice to see how some games utilize the adaptive triggers. The PS button is now the logo from PlayStation 1 instead of a circle which also works as a nice translation to P5 if you really want to get poetically crazy. The touchpad has a little more resistance because the way the surface is treated. Instead of a silky smooth matte surface like the DS4, this one seems like it‚Äôs just a matte surface without the silk. The face buttons all have a super nice soft, but tactile press.. Design wise, the controller is creatively constructed. I think a lot of thought has been put into the design than people would like to think and it deserves critique. The white portions of the controller protrude about 1/32‚Äù higher than the black striping. At first, I thought I would be able to feel what seems like annoying transitions between the two colors, but surprisingly, the white acts as a literal translation of where your hands will be when you hold the controller. It‚Äôs very diagrammatic; kind of like architecture that is designed in a way that when looked at, you can already understand the purpose of what the architect intended with material choices and geometric decisions.. Currently using it on my PC, but so far, it exceeds the Xbox 1 controller I have been at nearly all faucets. Only problem is that some companies like Ubisoft and Epic games seem to think no controller exists besides Xbox, so I sadly have to run Steam as an overlay to even use the dang controller. All in all, this controller is a shout-out to the PlayStation 1 with little Easter eggs and it really is a supremely constructed controller.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.2042916666666666,0.5902083333333332

Let me start off with this. The controller is really nice in the hands. A bit bigger then first gen ps4 controller(the comparison controller in the photos). The controller is a bit heavier and the triggers I can‚Äôt test yet. The biggest pro I see is that the big light on top of the ps4 controller that is blue for player one even on the dim setting was crazy bright. Ps5 controller fixed that. The controller feels like a PlayStation controller but has the size of an xbone controller. The only thing that seems like a step down is the one butting no one uses. The touch pad button. It feels a bit mushy compared to the previous gen. Altogether I‚Äôd give it a 4/5 stars. Durability with the triggers is a concern but for now I‚Äôm satisfied. Will update to see if it can be used on pc without software later.. Update 11/9/2020. Using steam, you can use the controller for now as a generic controller. Make sure that is selected.

1,5.0,"Well, there's honestly not much to say. Steam has native support for Xbox One, DualShock 4, and Switch Pro Controllers, so they will most likely, eventually, also develop for the DualSense. I'm not sure when that will be, but I trust Steam with that, since they had done an absolutely PERFECT job for the previous three.. Connecting it to PC was insanely easy, just hold SELECT and PS buttons for 3 seconds until the lights flash rapidly, intermittently, and select the controller as a Bluetooth Device on Windows.. It did not work immediately on Steam, I had to go into Big Picture (obviously) and configure it from there. What I did was register it as a generic controller by inputting each key for each action. It was honestly pretty simple, since Steam also shows you a picture of a controller and a green light for the current key you need to map.. After mapping the keys, I played some Dead Cells, and the experience was pretty flawless. The controller feels GREAT in my hand. It feels like an Xbox One controller... but with the DS4 layout. It has some satisfying heaviness to it. Not that much, but you can definitely feel a good ""fullness"" in your hand when you compare it to a DS4. The shoulder, and especially trigger buttons feel better, too, since they are a bit larger now.. I do have a problem with the SELECT and START keys... they are really stiff. If you have a DS4 with those keys being stiff... oh yeah, these are even stiffer. Still clickable, but very stuff. Perhaps they will become less stiff over the time the more I use the controller, but we'll see.. However, some things are not customizable yet, like the DS4 is, such as changing the little light, or its color, and the touchpad. and its clicks. There's also a new button on the DualSense, which is the Mute Mic button as far as I know, and that's not mappable, either.. Again, Steam will most likely develop native support for the DualSense also, but for now, it works just like an Xbox Controller, and that's enough for me for now.. I have not tested the battery life yet, and I have no charged it yet, it already came with some charge (not sure if 50% or 100%).. So far I'd say I'm satisfied, and I'll update my review if anything happens (whether good or bad).. Original Review November 3rd - EDIT 5/30/2021:. Yup, this controller now has full native Steam Support, and dare I say much better than the DS4 even. Literally everything, EVERYTHING about it is customizable. The touch pad, the lighting, the mic button, anything you would want. It even shows the DualSense button shapes in Steam Big Picture. Connecting takes literally ONE SECOND only.

5,3.0,"This controller is good, and the size is perfect. The new technology in this controller are cool and fun, but in the end is a gimmick unless you truly care about a controller vibrating in your hands. Now for the giant flaw with the controller, the adaptive triggers. While cool to feel your gun kick our pressure from a gas pedal, this feature will ultimately ruin the controller. So, a small motor turns a plastic screw that turns a plastic gear to simulate different actions you may experience in the game. Great, but did they plan for the force of the human finger to push back against these components? or did they use durable enough parts? So far in my experience- no. As of right now on both of my PS5 controllers, the right trigger is very loose and sometimes triggers on it own. I believe this to be because of the function of the adaptive trigger forcing back against my trigger pulls. Maybe I have bad luck, but I'm two for two and am not looking forward to buying another.. Also the games I play are Dirt 5, COD Cold War, Borderlands 3, and Warframe- all with this feature, so I suggest shutting it off.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.12425183512140033,0.5822887257669866
6,1.0,"When it works, it's a nice controller, but unfortunately the buttons (particularly the square button) stick... Meaning you push it down and it doesn't pop up at all, or pops up very slowly. We got one of these for xmas and after a few days the buttons started sticking. Amazon kindly exchanged it for another unit and the same thing happened after a few days, so now we're returning that one for a refund. Some googling suggested blasting the buttons with compressed air and/or putting the controller next to a heat vent for a little while. Both of these remedies maybe improved things by 10% for a few minutes. Seems like a design flaw, which I'm assuming they'll get sorted in a future revision.

7,4.0,"I usually wait well into a generation to get a new console. First reason is obvious: launch units are notoriously buggy and prone to failure and usually within a year or two the console has had several sku's & model numbers with modifications that aren't visual but internal. Sony has made it a tradition to introduce a ""Slim"" model 2-3 years into the generation. But now with the PS4 Pro it's reasonable to assume a ""point 5 (.5) Pro"" upgrade version will also join the tradition.. Second reason I usually wait is games. Launch games are hit and miss & in low numbers. Because most have a previous generation version as well (Miles Morales for PS4, etc) it can be argued that true next gen games take a year or two to arrive. Indeed one of the big selling points of the PS5 is that it will play PS4 games with superior performance, hopefully doing away with the endless ""remastered"" versions of previous gen games.. When I first got a PS3 in 2012 there was a ton used games for pennies on the dollar of the price they debuted with. I still have plenty of highly rated PS3 games in my backlog that were bought for $5. I didn't get a PS4 until last year (a Pro actually), and since the PSN deals were so insane I started buying digital games only. Come on, $10 for all three BioShock games remastered? Like the PS3 I have tons of PS4 games I haven't played.. Which brings us to this controller and why would I buy it. Last gen I bought a DualShock 4 right after they came out (before the PS4, just like the DualSense came out before the PS5), after hearing it worked on PS3. It doesn't work on everything and the PS button doesn't work period. But it's damn sure more comfortable than a DS3.. Which is why I bought the DualSense. Word came that it too played on PS3 and I just thought oh well and ordered one. Now it is a nice controller, very comfortable and well made, but for me the DS4 is still the best controller I've ever used. The round handles are a bit more balanced than these XBox style wings on the DSense. It's still worth owning as it's very comfortable and if you can't get a PS5 or are waiting like me, you will be assimilated to the controller by the time you get a PS5...um, or PS5 Pro. If it was black we'd be in 5 star territory, but that grey off white is just too blah...Still, a great controller from Sony.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.12569116489571033,0.4064958021776205
8,3.0,"Ergonomically speaking, the controller feels an once or so heavier than the Dualshock 4, and also a bit thicker from the end of the handle to inside of the grip. A few changes have been made this generation, such as the exclusion of the light bar and the charging standard from micro usb to usb-c. The menu buttons(ie...start and share) have also been raised for easy access, along with a larger pad button. There is even an inclusion of a mute button over the headphone jack, which is cool. Overall the controller feels like a quality product, but without a PS5 on hand(yet) it's to be seen if battery life will exceed the pathetic 4-4.5 hrs we got last gen. One odd omission is the exclusion of a usb-c charging cable. Even xbox controllers shipped with 2 AA batteries and those controllers retail between 40-50 bucks. A 70 dollar controller without a charging cable seems like an odd oversight, but if the console comes with one, it's not a major deal. Overall, the Dualsense feels like a quality product, but its lack of compatability with PS4 and lack of charging cable seems like this should have just been another 50 dollar controller.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,-0.02723214285714286,0.3821428571428571

If you are sensitive to controller weight this thing is possibly a major health hazard. While I was gaming online I described it as feeling like I was holding a lead bar to my friends.. I'm also going to say that changing the home button from a normal-ish button to a funky cutout PS is a horrible idea.

2,4.0,"So this isn't a complete and comprehensive review as I am not using this with a PS5 but rather a PC and android tablet. I can report that it works for both, but there are some caveats to be addressed.. First, regarding the build the control is just superb feeling in the hand and kind of swanky. It just feels good in your hands. The buttons are not clicky but rather buttery smooth yet still responsive. The whole form factor brings about that classic and nostalgic familiarity that we've come to expect with PS controllers, but it still manages to create it's own futuristic image, and again, feel.. On PC, yes it's true Steam is your best friend. Don't expect much support outside of Steam unless you are using DS4 which is buggy at best. Functional! But buggy. Yes you can pair the controller with your PC if you have bluetooth on your system but Windows itself likes it best if you use a USB-C cable and wire this puppy in. Steam could care less what you use, bluetooth or cable, it will pick it up. Within Steam you can customize the button layout as you see fit and the controller can be used as it were a distinct Playstation controller and not a generic controller dressed up like an Xbox 360 controller.. With that being said there is an issue with the duelsense functions and the track pad and neither feature seems to function well. Not, necessarily a deal breaker for me, but still kind of a bummer nonetheless.. With regards to android, the controller can be paired with your phone or tablet and it work within games that actually have controller support. The problem is there aren't that many games that have full controller support to begin with. So there is that. Also on Android don't expect to be able to customize the controls at all. There are much cheaper options for this use case that will get the job done, but if you happen to have one of these on hand and you want to do some Android gaming, this will work with titles that have the support.. My one gripe is that the controller doesn't come with a Type C cable. Nothing. A box, instructions of sorts, and the controller. I guess Sony thought cables are cheap enough and you can just go get your own.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.35833333333333334,0.4980555555555556
3,5.0,"Update Post 4-9-21. I stand by my original post. I just wanted to say something to Sony and its execs. Not that I expect them to ever see this. But you seriously are missing out on a huge market share. If the goal of your company is to earn a profit, you are leaving a huge chunk of it untapped. You truly should offer full PC Drivers and support software for the Dualsense to be fully recognized and utilized by a PC. This is supposed to be the most advanced controller and I would agree, but it fails in its versatility. The Xbox still has the right idea there and sells tons of controllers even to those who do not have a console. Sony would dominate the market for PC gamer controllers if the Dualsense was fully supported. Many people own a Playstation even if they own a PC, so it is not like Sony would be losing money. It also might introduce people to Sony and entice them to buy a Playstation when they may not have thought of it before. With the terrible planning for the release of the PS5, it is impossible to get one. Sony dropped the ball here as well and has encouraged a black market to flourish. Seriously the only way to get a PS5 right now is to pay $1,000+ on the black market. So until I can get my hands on a console, I at least have a controller to complete the pair and until I can get a PS5 I love to use my Dualsense for my PC gaming. It's just too bad I cannot get the full experience of this awesome controller and I have to rely on patchwork third-party drivers and apps.. Original Post. The Dualshock and Dualsense may not be very PC friendly compared to Xbox, Logitech and other PC-specific controllers. But this did pair with my laptop bluetooth without issue. Just keep in mind whether a game supports this controller or not is still kind of iffy. Steam is improving it's support for the Dualsense with each update and I hear it even supports the haptic feedback these controllers have now. So as time goes on hopefully these controllers get friendlier with a PC.. Until then, some games are spotty. Epic game's Fortnite is one of those. the controller works fine when plugged in with a USB cable. But when using Bluetooth, the controller is not recognized by Fortnite. HOWEVER, I did discover you can get an emulator called DS4Windows (Dualshock 4 Windows). It is also adding support for the Dualsense. After installing this emulatore, I was able to use my PS5 Dualsense while paired through bluetooth and not plugged in, to play Fortnite with ease.. It is a beautiful cnontroller. It does not feel cheap and has a good heft to it, but not one to tire your hands. I always loved the layout of the Playstation controllers more than the Xbox ones. The only thing is that Sony got cheap and did not include a charging cable with the controller, you only get that when you buy the console. So you have to buy a USB-C cable and you need to make sure it is a higher end cable that can handle it such as:. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NF2LDJ8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

They brought all the nice ergonomics from the ps4 controller to this controller, which I appreciate a lot. However, there's no good or reliable software to use this controller with on PC, not right now anyway. Using it on Steam Big Picture might be ok, but I personally don't like Steam Big Picture, it feels kinda goofy and I don't think it looks very good. My major problem, is that I couldn't connect wireless earbuds at the same time that this controller is connected. I like to use Samsung Galaxy buds and a mic stand when I game, and had no issues with this when using a ps4 controller. With the dualsense controller, both devices intermittently disconnect and reconnect. I'm not sure if this would be an issue with other wireless hearing devices; from what I know, other gaming headsets come with their own bluetooth adapter, so connecting both shouldn't be an issue in that case. But even with how nice this controller feels, it's not worth the hassle if you're gonna use it for PC, not until someone makes some good software for it.

9,3.0,"Jury's still out on whether it's really better than the DS4. Only time will truly tell. The triggers definitely feel better constructed this time, trigger pressure decay was the beginning of the end for my DS4 and required a ton of Macguyvering and software adjustment to keep functional. I have noticed slight stick drift at the top of the left analog already in just 6 months, which I was able to fix with compressed air and guard against with a sensitivity increase and quadratic accel ratio in DS4Windows (which works with DS5). The mic and speaker also work with Windows so that can be pretty useful, especially if you don't have a headset with a built-in mic.. My biggest gripe is really just that the L1/R1 buttons feel a little more ""xbox like"" in line with the shape of the controller, and aren't quite as responsive as on the DS4. More resistance. But still if you are a PC gamer it's hard to beat the features of the DS4 and DS5 with how you can set up a TON of extra custom binds both to different touchpad region clicks or directional swipes, and the gyro aim is really handy if you wanna emulate Nintendo's motion controls or even use it for mouse aim assist in Steam controller configs.. Apparently the controller is also more complex to disassemble which gives me some concern. Prying out the black part that houses the sticks seems really sketchy. But eventually everyone's probably gonna need to take a crack at it at some point down the line if they want to mod or repair it. At any rate if they did manage to make the triggers more durable that'd be a win in my book.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.19042658730158732,0.46805555555555556
0,1.0,"This is coming from someone who went through a 360 controller and three DS4 controllers before the Dualsense came out - all of those lasted me at least 1200 hours of heavy use before stick drift started to get out of hand on the left stick. I used to be a semi-pro Rocket League player so this made sense since the game is massively taxing on the left joystick, and even more so after speed-flipping became a required mechanic at the highest levels (essentially smashing the stick 180 degrees and dragging it clockwise as fast as you can every time you flip while sub-sonic; they might as well call it the ""how to get stick drift 101"" technique).. That's not the problem I am experiencing with the Dualsense, though. I don't play games nearly as much as I used to, and the one or two games I do play with a controller (RL and Dark Souls) require very little and very gentle use of the right stick. So why did it suddenly develop an ùò¶ùòπùòµùò≥ùò¶ùòÆùò¶ drift upwards? If I so much as breathe on the right stick when it's centered, the input goes straight to 100% in the up direction and stays there until I move it around, click it a few times, click it outwards, and sacrifice a goat or two to the Sony gods. At which point, pray you don't breathe on it again, lest the process need to be repeated again. No deadzone can help because the drift goes right to the limits of the stick every single time without exception. I have never seen this before in any controller I've owned and it just so happens to have come up immediately after the return period expired so there's nothing I can do about it besides spend $70 on another that will likely do the same thing in a few months time.. Needless to say this makes most every game borderline unplayable, and the only workaround I can think of is disabling the right stick altogether and simply using the touchpad or motion tracking in its place. This would only work in games that have steam controller support though so I'd have to resort back to my left stick drifting DS4 for anything else like FIFA or NHL, which at least has a drift small enough to be negated by a sizeable deadzone. It's a real shame because in every other way this controller is far superior to the DS4: it's way more chunky, the sticks feel solid (or at least they did before they broke, lol), and it's incredibly ergonomic, but this obscene stick drift is a total deal breaker. I guess I'll have to go back to buying a DS4 once every 18 months or so and just hope they don't stop making them - a pattern I was hoping to break once the Dualsense came out, but it appears to me that the problem has only worsened...",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.04821793002915452,0.48804664723032065

The gyro sensor works as expected. Perhaps a little more accurate than the PS4, but I couldn't tell. However, the haptic feedback is very impressive. Mileage will vary depending on developer implementation, but it makes a big difference when used. (Especially in games like Dirt 5). The rear triggers also have haptic feedback and they add to the immersion too. Tried them in various games, including Call of Duty, and they do make a difference. That said, they are not so intrusive so as to demand your attention and be a distraction.. The sticks feel like they're made of better quality materials than the PS4 controller had too.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.25089285714285714,0.5666666666666667
3,5.0,"I usually don't write reviews, but this controller is a whole different beast. There's nothing else like it on the market. It is well built with the perfect size for most hands. There's also a little easter egg on the back of the controller, being that the grip for you to hold the controller is made out of little (and I mean like microscopic) X, O, Triangles and Squares. I think it's a very nice little touch and it just shows how much effort sony put in to make this the best controller they possibly could. Now, the one con of the controller is that you have to jump through tons of hoops to get it working on PC, but this is an issue only because the PS5 hasn't come out yet at the time I'm writing this review, and they haven't made the drivers public yet. There is a way, but you have to go on youtube to figure it out (took me about 30 minutes to get it working but after that it was flawless). Overall, this is the best controller you can get at the moment, and I highly recommend getting it now if you have a PC or a PS4 (and also for some reason it works on PS3, sort of). If you're just waiting on the PS5 and you want one of these early, I would highly recommend getting it now before it goes out of stock because it truly is the BEST CONTROLLER.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.2597826086956522,0.49931159420289856
4,1.0,"I had to give so many excuses why I bought this controller and I can't do it anymore, I have to admit this is a poorly made controller, I'd even go as far to say a Bad one.. Firstly I want to say this: I primarily used it for pc gaming.. When I first tried connecting the controller i had to go through so many loops for my pc to even registered it. However when the stars aligned and I sacrificed my first born child to our lord and savior bill gates and my pc finally register my DualSense, it was as consistent and reliable as my ex girlfriend, disconnecting every 12 seconds or 20 minutes. Not to mention for some reason my L2 and left stick were binded togetherf for some games. oh before I forget, my god is this controller heavy, it's about half as big and half as heavy as the ps4 controller and after 40 minutes of playing I feel my wrist starting to hurt. I seriously can't recommend this controller to someone who wants to game on pc, they're better off going back to the ps4 controller, an xbox controller or the donkey kong kongos, at least they're more consistent than this paperweight.",Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller,0.04166666666666667,0.39871794871794874

8,5.0,"The PS5 is amazingly fast! The startup, the loading of games and levels are a breath of fresh air for console gaming.. The Dualsense controller, though, is really what puts this console over the top in terms of immersion and that feeling of something new for this generation. It FEELS like next gen with games like Astro's Playroom. The feeling it provides really adds something that is amazing and fresh and once it's implimented properly in games, like Astro's, you won't want to play without it.. The size and weight feels just about right for me. My hands are on the larger side. Also, the battery life has been fine for my liking. My longest session without break was around 4-5 hours and I had 2 bars left at the end of it. Not the most scientific test but I rarely go for longer than that, so I'm ok with it.. The buttons, triggers and sticks feel good with decent feedback when squeezed/clicked. The adaptive triggers are part of the fresh experience along with the haptic feedback and together they really make this controller shine..

9,5.0,"First off I play on PC and for someone with large hands like myself the PS4 controller was basically unusable because of the shape, that being said, the new design is significantly more comfortable and is better for me then an xbox one controller. Compatibility on PC is great because I play 90% of my games on steam and any non steam games can just be added to your steam library. Haptic feedback is an interesting feature, it has a fidelity closer to a speaker then to any ruble motor, although it has no support on actual PC games you can still use it by running your audio through the controller, Adaptive triggers are the same for compatibility, you need to download 3rd party software to use it, but I wouldn't see myself using that as much as the haptic feedback as it tended to get annoying..

0,5.0,"This console is obviously not the most powerful console but if you are looking at consoles in the first place I'm guessing it's because you prefer value over a top-of-the-line experience. The reasons this particular console is my favorite to emerge from this new generation:. -Cost-. The $300 price point is cheaper than any other current gen console and is affordable by most gamer's standards.. -Value-. I've done a bit of comparing and you would be hard pressed to build a gaming pc with identical specs for this price. Obviously, a pc with an operating system like Windows 10 has many more capabilities and functionality over the consoles but even the most budget of pc builds would be hard to accomplish at this price point.. -Physical Build-. I've seen multiple comparison pictures online but nothing beats getting your hands on one of these. It is the smallest console in the modern era and extremely well built. I also need to get my head about 4 inches from the exhaust fan before I can even hear it and I have excellent hearing.. Conclusion: Unless you absolutely need the 4k gaming and/or the use of physical discs that the Series X provides, I think this one is a no-brainer.",Xbox Series S,0.19216073781291176,0.5202286843591192

I will use it principally with the Game Pass, considering is digital, i cannot use the physical games on it. This is also a great option you pay $120 a year and have access over 360 games including new exclusives, it is like the Netflix of videogames, purchasing a game at launch will cost $60 each. Game Pass is a very economic way to save and play a lot.. I am very impressed about such great work Microsoft is doing, making possible and affordable the access to new generation console and games, this is an impressive deal for who does not want to spend much and play this generation games with quality, 1080p or 2k mostly at 60fps it is optimal, you barely notice the diference of quality with 4k if you are using a 40 to 50 inch TV, the SSD is another advantage that this console has compared to the previous generation, as fast as Series X loading times, i really cant spot any difference..

2,5.0,After playing on my Xbox Series S for a month now I can say I am happy with this little beast console ! This console can play new Xbox One and old Xbox 360 games if it's backwards compatible. The fast load times are amazing on current Xbox games and the increase frame rates are also very much welcomed. I redownloaded alot of past games just to try out how it stacks against my old Xbox One X there just no comparison to how stable it is plus most games are getting a X/S upgrade to take advantage of the new hardware. Then comes the downside to the Series S the internal hard drive only 346 GB is just way too small to build a library of games. You will constantly be deleting/reinstalling and good luck with updates. Sure you can fix this with buying a external hard drive but gotta sacrifice that fast load time or even the pricy $219 SSD just to maintain that fast load time for only 1 TB. If you can get past the small storage space then I would highly recommend you pick up a Xbox Series S to play your current games/older games at higher speeds or framerate but if your wanting bigger space and more graphical enhances of the new games coming down the line then get a Xbox Series X.,Xbox Series S,0.10623718243036427,0.4896388123660851
3,5.0,"Unboxing: I ordered through a third party reseller (RedRev). The packaging used to transport the item was good enough. The actual product box has aesthetic damage to it but the contents of the box were in mint condition. It does appear though that the box had been opened and retaped as the tape job left much to be desired. In the end the product arrived to me in working condition with no damage to the console or other peripherals/cables.. Product: Overall I'd find it easier to recommend the Series S over the Series X even once the shortage issue comes to pass. 4k is still relatively niche, especially 4k120hz TV. I personally use a 1440p165hz monitor for my tower and will be using the same one for my Series S. My only issue is gimping out on performance for the Series S. The Series S has raytracing but is fairly limited compared to its bigger brother. I feel if the Series S had been able to target that same quality of raytracing at a lower resolution it could be a better product. The FPS targets also leave much to be desired. Aside from that the Series S is worth the money. I'd recommend getting an external SSD over the proprietary storage (the expansion card) simply due to the price (you may as well get the Series X at that point). The sacrifice in load times will be worth more than the hole in your wallet from buy a 200+ USD expansion card (even if it is an NVMe drive).",Xbox Series S,0.11994047619047617,0.3111607142857143

Update July 21: after over a month use it works perfectly. I haven't had any issues with it",Xbox Series S,0.12023809523809523,0.5476190476190476
7,5.0,"Loads games at stupid fast speeds, far faster than any last gen system could even come close to, this includes transitioning through menus and apps. Console is slim and compact, vents heat well and is near silent even when it's rendering heavy performance games.. The only compliant I have is the storage size, it states 512gb but due to updates and system firmware it needs the system comes out to 364gb of usable space left. More and more modern games are edging up with the 60+ gb size catagories, this effectively limits the amount of games you can have installed vastly compared to series X.. The system storage info can infact be remedied! With the additional purchase of the Seagate storage expansion card, which is unfortunately around $200 itself on top of a console that costs $300-$400 ( depending on who, what, when, and where you buy it) which in total brings itself up to the price of a series X of around $500.. Overall I am happy with my purchase as it suits my needs perfectly and may even exceed them.

I should have just saved up a few hundred more and got the Xbox X.... this console is not worth the price to be honest. I am waiting on amazon to send me a replacement and hopefully this one works because I am not happy at all. Even the speed of the loads and graphics are not enough at this point for me to be happy. Also, cannot turn on console with the controller.... really??..... UPDATE: Amazon sent me a replacement... its better, but I stil have problems. The graphics are nice, the load speed is also great. I still have some problems with overheating, and I have 4 friends who have the exact same problem with their xbox S.... It helps to put a cooling fan on it, but that is just frustrating. I have not seen a console overheat like this in my life.... it feels like I just took it out of the microwave sometimes LOL!

Managed to install a few titles I wanted to try but hadn't picked up yet.. Overall, a fantastic purchase. I know the Series X is the ""higher-quality"" version, but the Series S is a nice and affordable (if you can get it base value like I did, $299) alternative that let's you play next gen games on your TV.

5,5.0,"Came in a day early and delivered in original and unopened packaging. Everything was in the box.

When I say to long I don‚Äôt mean the time it gives you. I mean if you pauso for a minute or two between steps it might completely forget that you entered the code from the app. You can choose to continue without it but thought it was a cool user experience to control my Xbox with my iPhone. Also know that I downloaded about 5/6 games before the storage wasn't enough so get an eternal drive too depending on what you‚Äôre getting.

But because of the price gouging and the fact that I was more likely able to find a new Series S at the $299 tag given at the right moment, I've decided to go for this instead. After owning it for over a month, it has worked well. The quick resume feature is one of the things I like about this console. The hardware design and the fact that it has less weight than my One S is another thing I like about it as well. Only downside is that there is no optical drive which I knew about already. So no more playing my disks. However, it was still worth getting it. I did buy a 4TB external hard drive since I know 512GB isn't going to be enough.

8,4.0,"Honestly can't beat the price for what you get with the Series S and a game pass ultimate subscription. I don't collect physical media for Xbox platforms so I didn't feel it was necessary to leap for the Series X for that reason. It is a fast, responsive piece of hardware that really performs above my expectations. It comes as an amazingly small form factor which is refreshing as my PS5 is enormous and takes up a lot of space. I have encountered no issues while playing it. Performance-wise I have encountered some minor artifacting when playing some games such as Quantum Break. Side by side with the PS5 it is obviously outperformed but I'm not really playing Xbox for graphically intense games. I love the Game Pass economy and this gets me access to all of that. It comes with 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, which seems on the lower end as the Series X comes with 1TB but I really haven't run into issue with it as I don't typically play large file sized games. I could and probably will purchase the Seagate Expansion card at some point but I don't feel that is necessary at this time.. A note for the shipment packaging: the package arrived with a dent along the top of the box that was pretty severe. As you can see in my pictures, the damage to the items packaging could have been avoided by added another air pack along the top and right side. Luckily, Microsoft was smart with their internal packaging to avoid any damage to the xbox itself. Where the dent extends into the packaging is where the controller, HDMI cord, power cord, and batteries are.. 4 stars for my overall rating of the Series S, 2 stars for packaging on Amazon's part..

Played this for 30 minutes with my 3 kids and I'm pretty sure we all need therapy. The camera has a very small range and chases the person farthest ahead. The chasing is common with Mario, the small camera range makes it a nightmare. It also is 3D so there is foreground and background to explore, not a single linear course. This might work as a single player or maybe two player cooperative but not four. It also randomly switches your characters at the start or stages, huge huge tear fest with the little kid crowd.

2,4.0,"Hard to believe that this past year, we celebrated the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers. While it had not been as strong as many gamers had expected, we still got a lot of great toys and games featuring Nintendo's proud mascot. We got the Super Mario 3D All-Stars package, which had Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Sunshine & Super Mario 64. But other Mario titles flowed to the Switch as well like Paper Mario: The Origami King. Still, when you look at games from the Wii U, you had almost all of the Mario games go to Switch already, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and New Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe. But one game that has not made it to Switch until now is Super Mario 3D World. The game was well-received for Wii U owners, but not as strongly sold, due to the lackluster sales of Wii U. Still, Nintendo pressed on and decided to release it for the Switch. Sadly, the game was suppose to be released last year, but got held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it is here, with a added bonus.. Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, is a 2-in-1 purr-fectly conjured compilation where Super Mario 3D World is remastered and includes new features made for Switch, and the new mini-adventure Bowser's Fury which takes a unique twist on the Mario formula. First for Super Mario 3D World, the game looks great and brings in all the wonderfully made platforming from the Wii U game, with some small tweaks to make it work a bit better. In the game, Mario & his friends need to rescue Pixie Princesses that Bowser and his minions have captured. Along the way, Mario, Peach, Toad & Luigi each all maneuver with new and returning features like the thrilling Cat Suit, which allows Mario & friends to maneuver in new and challenging ways. You can now climb up walls, attack like a feline and skid through pathways that are more challenging than ever. You also have courses that are new for Switch owners to hover through like Red-Hot Run, The Great Goal Pole, and the towering Champion's Road which will get you screaming for more.. You also have a new game here: Bowser's Fury, where Mario must team-up with Bowser Jr. in a epic quest to save Bowser from a uncontrollable raging toxin where got into and becomes Fury Bowser (a towering Ganon-like creature) bent on mayhem to destroy Lake Lapcat. In this game, Mario must partner with Bowser Jr. on the quest to save Bowser from the raging being he has became. The game plays more like a Super Mario Odyssey adventure with Mario 3D World twists, packed-down into 1 major overworld. In the game, Mario and Bowser fight cat-themed foes like Boom Boom, Bullies and unlock puzzles and collect items and find the guarded cat shines to unlock bells that will help Mario & Bowser Jr. stop the unraveled Fury Bowser. The game itself is fun, but does feel interesting as a concept to make a condensed Super Mario 64-esque game. It works well, and the game looks amazing with the designs and platforming. In itself, the campaign may be short, but will take your fiery breath away when you play it. I think it looks charming and puts in a new wrinkle on the Mario 3D platforming formula that worked so well from past games like Super Mario Galaxy 2.. There are a lot of things that work well with both of these games, with a few faults though. First of all, for Bowser's Fury, for skilled gamers of past Mario platformers, they may find the game shorter than other Mario titles, because of the main overworld. Some gamers would've wanted more overworld packed into the hub-world like earlier Mario titles, but it is actually interesting to put Mario into a Luigi's Mansion kind of setting. Also, you would also have to toggle with many different power-ups at once while battling Fury Bowser in the game that you may need that as a lifeline without losing lives. It may be shocking but sadly it is what it takes at times while controlling Mario & Bowser Jr. while mastering Bowser's Fury. While it may be repetitive, it still is a lot of fun playing. As for Super Mario 3D World, the main disadvantage is only if you have mastered the Mario adventure before from the Wii U era, you may not feel entertained with this game all over again. But nevertheless, considered that so many people never played the Wii U title, considered it was one of the weakest-selling game system from the Nintendo legacy, it still is worth playing at the end.. When you look at Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, it is a mixed bag for some fans of the Super Mario Brothers legacy. But nevertheless, it is a absolutely fun title worth checking out. You get two adventures of the furry-kind into one package that does work. While many people may feel Super Mario 3D World is not a strong buy, it is a strong buy because it is 2 adventures into one nearly purr-fect pair of escapades. As for Bowser's Fury, I did get what I wanted out of it, and would still want to intrigued with more when I missed on it. Still for what it is worth, pairing the 2 games in one compilation is worth the money. If they were sold apart, it would not be worth purchasing. Still, I absolutely recommend buying this game pack a lot. It can come across as a great pair of actual purr-fect strangers.. Graphics: A-. Sound: B+. Control: B+.

8,5.0,"In the midst of so many Wii U games getting a re-release on the Switch I knew it would only be a matter of time before Super Mario 3D World received that re-release. Like many Wii U titles, this one was a gem overlooked due to the Wii U's low sales. Also like many Wii U exclusives, it means that so many missed out on it the first time. What makes Super Mario 3D World so special is that it's simply among the best Mario experiences you could have. It takes the best of Mario's 2D adventures and combined it with (then) the best of Mario's 3D adventures. It was the ultimate time capsule of everything that made Mario great, and so many people missed out on it. It is still a quint essential experience for Mario fans simply because of the time capsule it is, and remains even as Super Mario Odyssey has hit the scene.. Mario games are never a plot driven affair. Normally they all involve Peach getting kidnapped and Mario going to save her. This one is different. In this one, however, Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach find a magic pipe that looks to be in disrepair. Mario and Luigi fix it... only for a Sprixie to emerge and explain to Mario and company that Bowser has come and imprisoned much of their population. She only speaks briefly before Bowser comes from the pipe, traps her in a jar and disappears. Fearing the worst, Mario and company hop into the pipe to go to this new world.. The plot setup, if you couldn't tell, is largely ripped from the US version of Super Mario Bros. 2, only this time it isn't a dream. Also like Super Mario Bros. 2, you can choose between the four heroes: Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach. Each one has the abilities that made them worthwhile in that first outing way back in 1988. Mario is perfectly balanced, Luigi jumps the highest, Toad is the fastest and Peach can briefly hover in the air. There aren't a ton of reasons to use one character over another, however. Most of the stages are designed to be traversed in a similar manner.. The game mixes the best of 2D and 3D Mario adventures. The game has a level by level design and a world map like 2D Mario games, but the over map acts as a hub similar to 3D Mario games. This means that instead of Mario following a pre-determined path you're actually free to explore the map without going on a track like in previous adventures. Sometimes you want to do this. The worldmaps sometimes contain Toad houses for items, 1UP Mushrooms, coins or even divergent paths to certain bonuses. Each time you complete a level you unlock new levels, sometimes multiple levels, and you don't have to complete every single stage to get to Bowser. There are even warp pipes (though not very many).. Each stage centers around a concept. You're always introduced to this concept in a safe environment before it ramps it up. What makes this intersting for Super Mario 3D World is that it manages to make every level feel unique, experimental and fresh. Even if a concept gets repeated, there's an intersting twist on it that completely changes how you interact with it. You can get a small idea of what the concept is before jumping in. The stages themselves are usually fairly straight forward, but there are certain things to keep in mind as you go. The main goal of every level is to make it to the flag pole, but every level also contains green stars. Collecting these is important. As the game progresses you'll need them to unlock levels the further you get. Luckily there are green stars found in other places too such as mystery box stages, or doing the Captain Toad Treasure Tracker mini game. There are also stamps to collect in each stage, though this doesn't add much. It's just a collectible.. Mario and company also have the ability to use various different suits and powerups. In most 3D Mario games, Mario's powerups are temporary, but here it takes a page primarily from Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World where the powerups are permanent until you get hit, and where you can store one to swap out at any time. There are familiar power ups. The majority of which you've seen before. The fire flower is a staple. The game also gives you the boomerang suit once again from Super Mario 3D Land, the Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3 returns, and so does the Mega Mushroom from New Super Mario Bros. The big introduction here, however, is the cat suit. With it you can use a forward attack to hit any enemies in your way, do a front dive, and climb up walls. This is especially useful as you can also climb the flagpole at the end of a level for a free 1UP with the catsuit equipped. There are also temporary powerups that can't be taken out of a level, but are useful when you find them. There's an ice skate in some ice levels that you can ride around it, propeller boxes to hover, and also mobile cannons you can carry around.. In addition, Mario has access to a lot of moves he normally only has in 3D games. Mario can long jump, backflip, side jump, and wall jump. This allows for more flexibility within the level design, and sometimes this encourages you to explore in the levels themselves.. Super Mario 3D World doesn't provide a huge challenge. Instead the engagement is based on the game's rather intersting level designs and tight platforming. If there is one game which demonstrates the absurdity of a life count in this day and age it is most certainly the Mario series (which, thankfully, Odyssey did away with). Super Mario 3D is going to shower you with 1UPs. Even if you falter, it's not unusual to find enough coins, hidden 1UPs or reach the top of a flagpole. Even more than that, if you fail at a stage more than 5 times, the game offers you a Super Leaf that will make you invincible to enemies to get through it. This is purely optional, but the point is that Super Mario 3D World isn't really out to punish you for screw ups.. What CAN make the game unusually challenging, however, is multiplayer. Much like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, 3D World supports up to 4 players simultaneously. This can make some courses easier, but more often than not multiplayer is a hazardous experience that will be prone to ending friendships. In the first place, the camera only really centers on player one. More importantly it's easier to do such things as pick up friends and throw them into pits, jump on them and screw them up, or just get in each others way. This doesn't multiplayer can't be fun, it just means that if you're goal is progress through a stage you may find that this is a much bigger challenge when some courses require everyone to be on the same page. You can also play multiplayer online, but this has had mixed results (at least for me) and is even worse simply because a precise platformer like Super Mario 3D World... was simply not made for lag, should you encounter it. Stick with local multiplayer here if you're looking to play with friends.. There are a few noticeable differences from the Wii U version. The most eye-popping is that the game simply has a cleaner look and is playing at a much higher resolution. In fact, the game overall runs much faster. Characters move through levels faster, and everything flows much better. This is going to make you think that levels are short, but really it's just that progress through them is much quicker than you remember. You no longer have access to the Miiverse, which is no big loss. But the biggest addition here is ""Bowser's Fury,"" which is a new game in which you get to explore an island collecting Cat Shines. Every now and then Bowser will surface, you'll have to hide from him as he wrecks havoc, and then you'll resume. Once you've found enough in any given area you can become Giga Mario in cat form and battle Bowser. At first this seems fun, but the reality is that it gets old really fast. It looks beautiful, it flows seamlessly, but after a couple of hours of it, you're just going to go back to 3D World.. If there were any downsides to Super Mario 3D World it would primarily be that some aspects of Mario games are not quite as charming as they once were. I mentioned the life system feels obsolete in a game that is so quick to dole out so many lives. The timer also doesn't feel necessary anymore. The only time you'll feel like time is of the essence is if you get stuck trying to find one last green star, only to have to start a level over again because of time. But the timer simply isn't that big a deal, or that constricting. It just doesn't really have a reason to be here other than because 2D Mario games once used it. Neither of these things is really detracting from the game, but it's hard not to notice them.. All of that said, it's hard not to admire the creativity put into the game's levels and design. Super Mario 3D World remains one of Mario's best outings. It takes the best of 2D Mario games and combines them with the best of the 3D games. It allows for Super Mario 3D World to represent the best of what the Mario series has offered us over time. Given that Mario's next major outing to follow 3D World originally was Super Mario Odyssey, it felt like a love letter back in the days of the Wii U before Mario would evolve once again. Today, it serves as a reminder of where Mario has been as we remember the legacy he has created. It is a worthwhile game to play and delightful for Mario fans. Especially those who enjoyed the games that Super Mario 3D World opts to pay tribute to.",Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch,0.1685601090451837,0.4848150191433774
9,5.0,"This is my review after playing this game for almost 2 months.. I never owned a WiiU system, so this game was perfect for me. The main plot is about bowser kidnapping the sprixie fairies, and in this game you can play as peach now that she isn‚Äôt kidnapped. (You can also play as rosalina after beating world star-2, peach and rosalina are perfect for little sisters, Princess lovers, etc) You can play as Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, and Rosalina. All have their ups and downs.. Mario- most balanced of them all, not much to say. Luigi- jumps higher but slides a little. Toad- runs fast, but is small and can‚Äôt jump very high. Peach- can float, but doesn‚Äôt run that fast. Rosalina- honestly the most op character, can‚Äôt think of a bad thing about her but she‚Äôs like Mario but with the spin move from super Mario galaxy.. The multiplayer gets criticized for being, ‚Äútoo chaotic‚Äù, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve had for a while.. The game has 11 worlds In total.. World 1- the easiest world, very grass themed and made to introduce new players, not the best to replay. World 2- desert themed, a little bit harder than world 1. World 3- Ice themed, has lots of fun, creative levels (such as the super Mario kart snes themed level). World 4- Also desert, very challenging. World 5- also ice, world 5 has some fun levels such as the golden express. World 6- cloud themed, the best world in the game in my opinion, lots of creative levels. World Castle (7)- lava themed, {spoiler alert} not the final world in the game, but a very fun one and very replayable. World Bowser (8)- carnival themed, this world is bad*ss. The big bowser animatronic, the music, and that‚Äôs just the hub world. This is home to some very challenging levels too.. World star- space themed, very fun levels and awesome new unlockable character.. World mushroom- harder remixes of other levels, very fun and hard. World flower- like world mushroom, but with different levels and more harder. World crown- the hardest levels in the game, such as champions road. And that‚Äôs just the worlds. There are also the power ups.. Mushroom- gives you a boost in life, turns small Mario into big Mario. Fire flower- throws fireballs. Star- invincible for about 5 seconds. Super bell- turns you into cat Mario, you can pounce and scratch and climb and dive.. Tanooki leaf- turns you into tanooki Mario, you can float and stuff. Boomerang- you can shoot boomerangs. There are more, but those are the main ones.. Super Mario 3D world is fun. But we haven‚Äôt talked about bowsers fury, the new content.. In bowsers fury you go around lake lapcat collecting cat shines. Collect enough to get the giga bell to fight fury bowser. Bowser jr also helps you because he wants his dad back to normal. The lake lapcat is full of cat trees, enemies, and even pigeons. Every thing is cat themed.. This game is fairly short and I 100%ed it In a month (I could have 100%ed it faster, but I was also playing 3D world). Overall this whole game is worth $60.. But only if you don‚Äôt have 3D world. This game is not worth the $60 price if you also have 3D world. Bowsers fury is NOT worth $60. If They released it separately, it would be about $20. This game is mainly for players you haven‚Äôt experienced the original 3D world yet. 3D world is the game I usually play, bowsers fury is a fun side, but again, it‚Äôs not worth a whole $60.. Other than that, awesome game. 9.5/10 and a big 5 star rating.",Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch,0.13128997421018698,0.460857833655706
0,5.0,This one one of my all time favorite Wii U games that has I have been waiting to get ported onto switch since New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe came out in 2019. With just about every port that comes over to switch Nintendo add in extras that more or less justifies its $60 price point for those who want to double dip & with bowsers fury its well worth it.,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch,0.2753787878787879,0.4609848484848485
1,5.0,My daughter is 5 and she loves this game. She can play it easily by herself either on hand held or on the television. The characters are so much fun and so are the story lines and backgrounds. My daughters main goal is to get the cat suit and it's her favorite character. I like the different worlds and levels and how unique they are. I also enjoy that it is up to 4 players and you can play this game multiple ways on a switch. Video games have come a long ways since I was a kid. The graphics are top notch and this game has hours of fun. It is challenging enough that you're not board but also easy enough for a 5 year old to play.,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch,0.14517543859649124,0.5157894736842107
2,4.0,"Just as it was eight years ago when it appeared for the WiiU, Super Mario 3D World is an extremely fun and addictive Mario game with a wide range of bite-sized levels that combine the challenge of 2D Mario games with a bit of the exploration we associate with 3D Mario titles. If you've played Super Mario 3D Land, it's a super-sized sequel to that game.. BUT be warned that the camera and the isometric perspective sometimes make 3D World more challenging (and frustrating) than it really needs to be. At first, the combination of the two and the unusual dash mechanic (at least unusual for Mario titles) will cause some real frustration, but if you stick with it for a bit (and consider playing in portable mode, which, for some reason, makes these elements easier to manage‚ÄîI suspect because 3D Land, on which this is based, was made for the 3DS), you'll minimize their impact.. Bowser's Fury, a sort of a cross between Super Mario Odyssey and 3D World, has Mario exploring a large map containing multiple smaller challenge areas, each of which includes several objectives, with occasional interruptions from a giant raging Bowser. It's interesting but (in my view) less focused and engaging than 3D World.",Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch,0.09991181657848322,0.49087301587301585
3,5.0,"Not only does it feel great on the switch but it plays better too! The game is a rich and masterful collection of new entertaining and exciting mechanics all explored in unique and interesting ways. You can't even be miffed by failing a challenge as the game provides you the tools (within reason) to succeed in a variety of ways and grooms you into being a master with careful course construction and consideration for exploration and character movement. It fits comfortable with a multitude of playstyles and though I have not beat the main game yet I would easily recommend it at the current price. It's well worth your time especially if you're a fan of the original World, Odyssey, Galaxy. or 3D Land on the 3Ds. This takes those same mechanics found on the 3Ds, tweaks them, adds the necessary flair and it's all flourish. Fantastic game and brilliantly beautiful.

4,5.0,"There are so many Wii U games that deserved more than what they got. This is no exception. 3D World is considered by many to be one of the best, if not best 3D Mario Platformers (Next to Oddesy). It is a no-brainer if you have never played this game to pick it up.. If you played this game on the Wii U, I would say it is probably still worth the pickup. There are a couple of changes to the main game and Bowser Fury is an all-new experience with Super Saiyan Mario!

6,5.0,"I did not have a Wii-U when Mario 3D world came out, so I was unable to play it until it was ported to Switch. My girlfriend and I have been having an absolute blast playing though the game in its entirety! Although the base levels don't take too long to complete, finding all the stamps and hidden stars makes for excellent gameplay for any completionist!. Bowsers' Fury is a uniqe taster/test for the future of 3D Mario games. It is very short, and has its frustrating aspects (in particular after you beat the main story bowser's fury becomes harder to calm down, and this harder for the player to focus on the levels). It uses the core gameplay of Mario 3D world in a more open-world environment which makes it effectively a true-to-form 3D Mario game similar to the likes of 64 and Odyssey, albeit a lot shorter. It is worth noting that the 2-player aspects of this are similar to Odyssey in that the second player is more like a companion/helper than anything else.. Definitely a must-have on the switch for any Mario/platformer lover!",Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch,0.025427350427350424,0.44822649572649576
7,5.0,"This game is a lot of fun and especially fun in multiplayer. I have played both locally and online with friends and both times were very seamless and a blast with everyone. You can select which characters you play as OR do a random assignment each world so there‚Äôs no worry about it being random all the time as I‚Äôve read in another review. It was actually best we assigned ourselves as one of my friends is color blind. This made it easier for him to play as Toad or Peach since they look completely different from Mario and Luigi.. I am beyond impressed with Bowser‚Äôs Fury though. I played and beat Super Mario 3D and went straight to BF with some hesitations. However I‚Äôm glad I stuck with it because I honestly had a lot of fun with the gameplay. It‚Äôs one big open world which was executed pretty well! Each island is ‚Äúa world‚Äù with its own goals for Cat Shines (this game‚Äôs stars) and there isn‚Äôt a need to go back to a main area to bounce into a new world. All you have to do is go to a different island! Also the mechanic of Bowser appearing at various times was a good touch to the gameplay.. Overall, I was impressed with it.

9,5.0,"A must-play for any fans of Mario or platformers in general. This is two games in one - a Switch port of the WiiU title, ""Super Mario 3D World,"" and, ""Bowser's Fury,"" a new title.. Super Mario 3D World is 3D Mario by way of Super Mario World - levels are linear stages. Unlike Mario 64 or Sunshine, with their open ended areas, and Galaxy, in which each level has several different variations on each revisit, 3D World sticks to individual linear courses. The player has less freedom, but the levels are more polished and varied. This is a different kind of game than other 3D Mario titles, but that isn't a bad thing. I especially recommend this title to any older gamers who miss the feel of the early 2D Mario titles - there is a lot of DNA from those classics baked in.. Bowser's Fury, meanwhile, is closer to a modern 3D Mario game, perhaps most closely resembling Mario 64, but housing its levels inside a seamless open world. The game is arguably worth the price of admission on its own, in spite of its brevity, and represents a massive step forward for 3D Mario titles. I'm reminded a bit of Jak and Daxter's overworld, but without its strict limitations as to what is and isn't, ""part of the game."" If you see a surface, you can jump on, dive off, or climb on it (with the appropriate power up) - allowing a lot of flexibility as to how you approach each challenge.",Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch,0.07204545454545455,0.49320707070707076
0,3.0,"Almost a decade old game (as of this review) now. The HD version has some quality of life improvements, but not enough in my opinion to keep it modernized as the game feels dated at times. In my opinion some changes should have been in the original game, not added 10 years later. For some improvements there seem to be a slight drawback compared to the original. The game still retains some of the best soundtrack, dungeons and boss battles in the series, but the padding,fetch quests/scavenger hunts to get to them can feel tedious.. Fun game at times, but I feel that once players hit these hurdles, filler segments they may drop the game and/or not complete it.. Button control option is nice, but for best experience you must swap back and forth between button and motion control. No hybrid option. If I had to choose whether to play the original or HD version, I'd play the HD version due to a smoother and more streamlined experience. When going back to the original it was harder and more time consuming to play. choosing whether to play another other 3D Zelda game it would choose those as even with the enhancements as this game is still the not the best in the franchise in my opinion. The asking price of $60 at launch is a bit steep though. Could have went with full remake instead of a few tweaks. ---Now onto the list of changes:. 1. Graphics.. Feels like a touch up rather than a redesign. Won't really see the difference unless you have the game side-by-side. If anything; it's how the game looks like in your head a decade ago (if you played the original). If you gave me a dozen blind screenshots, I may not be able to pick the correct version 100% of the time. Has a better draw distance when flying through the sky. Textures are bad.. Grass and trees look dead. Could have added individual leaves or blades of grass, instead looks like no one has watered them in years. Should have taken note from the Spongebob HD remake. Runs smoother at a steady 60fps (from 30fps in original). 2. Button Controls.. Can be toggled on/off at any time. No option to use both button and motion control simultaneously or hybrid of the two. Best when not in combat like when flying or swimming. To swing sword and other similar items; you must over flick right joystick which doesn't feel natural. Precise slashes when enemy block a certain way, doesn't translate well 100% of the time. Poking with a sword requires you to press into the joycon (R3 button). Shield with L3. No free movement with shields. Don't get why companies don't make controllers with L3, R3 back paddles instead of integrating it into the joystick... but that's a rant for another time.. To do a spin attack you must flick joycon left then right or vice versa really fast. Don't get why you can't just do circular motion like a grappling special move in fighting games.. Flick up/down really fast to do fatal blow. Feel like my joycons will get joycon drift sooner by using too much pressure on it. Camera controls are also bad in this mode (more on this later).. If you have adult sized hands; can get hand fatigue after a while. Recommend you use a pro controller. 3. Motion Controls. Works similar to the Wii version. It's responsive for swinging your sword. One-to-one movement is accurate for the most part. If you played the original and have adult sized hands now, the joycons small shape (compared to wii remote) doesn't help in making it feel like you're holding a sword...instead feels like a small dagger. Pointer controls to aim arrows, hookshot, ect works okay. At times it's off-center when you point at the screen.. You need to be calibrated every so often by pressing Y button since the Switch doesn't have motion censor bar for both joycons. 4. Camera controls.. With motion control you move the camera and go in all directions without having to hold Z button like in the original. Now you just use right thumb stick. No more awkward quarter turns. With button controls, you hold L to move the camera with the right stick, since the right thumb stick is to swing sword and items. At times I forget to press L button and I'd swing randomly which breaks immersion.. Optional camera motion/gyro controls are also available (best when sitting in rotating office chair). 5. UI. Icons are more detailed and clear. Names are added to text boxes. 6. Auto Save. Game has auto save feature. Able to save and override save slots. Before you had a dedicated save slot. Also more checkpoints at certain sections. 7. Optional help. Fi no longer give talk to you every few minutes. Sword now glows when she think you need help or discover something new. Now you just talk to her when stuck or want advice like your phone's smart assistant. Shika stones/hint videos removed. 8. Skippable Cutscenes and Text. Able to fast forward text, and skip cutscenes and text. less automated dialogue. NPC won't randomly talk to you when there's eye contact to start a pokemon battle...i mean start a conversation. You must walk up to them now. Which is better especially in the early game. New item description only shows up once. 9. Load Times. Up to 2x as faster. Wish it was instant. Guess i got spoiled by PS5. 10. Less grind?. Mandatory tutorials are optional in the beginning. Don't get why other fetch quests aren't optional too when it doesn't influence the overarching story. Guess Nintendo started making adjustments then ran out of development time, or got lazy or something. Progression is horrible in this game. It's linear and there's still a lot of padding in the game that artificially extends the game's length with no substance having to collect items in previously visited areas.. Essentially backtrack to progress without any incentive to do so; only prolonging your adventure with busy work bringing no meaning to your progression. If cut, can make a 30-35 hour game with unnecessary fetch quests to a quality 20-25 hour consistent enjoyable experience. Don't get why these segments are not minimized or omitted like in previous Zelda HD ports.. 11. Amiibo/instant fast travel. With Loftwing amiibo you can instant fast travel which is a super helpful quality of life feature.. Able to fast travel from wherever you are even in dungeons and houses, then fast travel back to the exact same spot. Extremely helpful if your shield breaks or need to restock on items. Like Monster Hunter, Metriod (with Difficulty level unlock), and other amiibos; it's very difficult to obtain due to scalpers buying all inventory and selling for 2x plus the price, and Nintendo making limited supply. Holding the feature hostage.. Some may say there are plentiful fast travel statues (which takes time to walk to, and adds up over time), but for those who want the option to travel instantly (within seconds) may have a hard time getting this physical DLC. There are options out there to unlock via NFC stickers for those who want this feature, but consumers should not have to jump through hoops in order to do so. Sad that Nintendo don't address this despite the huge backlash pre-launch. This should feature should be an in-game item by default or side quest reward in my opinion. ??. Additional Info. No HD Rumble support. No left handed mode. No voice acting. Hero Mode not available at start of the game. No additional story content, new dungeons, bonus content (Concept art gallery, Music playlist, etc)",The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,0.04249132716598469,0.4774376593725908
1,1.0,"The controls for this game are so bad, it makes the game almost unplayable. When the game 1st came out for the switch in 2011, the reviews mentioned the motion controls were wonky. No one wants to play multiple hours pointing a stick at a TV.. Although the devs slapped on some regular pad controls so that you don't have to use motion controls, it was implemented terribly. Have to hold L with R stick to move the camera, but the R stick also functions as sword control. Makes battles where you have to look almost impossible. Due to the bad camera, you tend to just fall off ledges and such doing mundane tasks like jumping from platform to platform.. The graphics are marginally better then the 2011 version, but all characters look really lame. Take a look at Zelda's dog ears for example. Video games have come a long way since 2011. This one really shows it's age (not in a good way).. I can't believe Nintendo released this pile and had the nerve to charge AAA title prices for it.

3,5.0,If you really liked Breath of the Wild this one might be hard to go back to. Like with any re-release of a game you are going to realize that some video game series have changed for the better.. If you are a fan of the Legend of Zelda series you are going to find something to love regardless of the games mechanics.. If your only interaction with the Zelda series has been Breath of the Wild then you might not enjoy this game all that much. This game follows the formula of the previous games that came out like Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The game is a little more structured and linear and doesn't have the big open world aspect that BOTW does.. The game mechanics haven't aged well and Nintendo did as best as they could to implement the motion controls of the Wii controller to the Right stick of the Switch Joy-cons. You can still play with motion controls if you choose but if you are using a pro controller or any other setup the motions are mapped to the Right Stick.. The music is outstanding and the 60 frames per second really helps with the gameplay. Be prepared to do a lot of reading though as this game doesn't have voice overs and instead relies on random sounds from the characters or an unknown language when they do talk.. If your kids loved BOTW but haven't played any other Zelda game I do not recommend this game to them. They won't enjoy it I can promise you that.,The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,0.01285392535392534,0.44066924066924085

6,4.0,"As a long-time Zelda fan, I've been itching for true dungeons from the franchise, an itch BOTW definitely doesn't scratch. I'm a few hours into it and despite having never played it, it gives me a lot of nostalgia. If you have ever played Twilight Princess then Skyward Sword will feel familiar. It looks great and aged well visually. It's worth the money if you've never given it a try but there are a few things that definitely take away from the experience.. 1. You can't use the right stick to pan the camera using a Pro Controller without holding down L.. 2. Moving around doesn't really feel smooth and he's moved on his own on more than one occasion.. 3. Certain items like rupees despawn much faster than they probably should, compared to other games.. 4. The motion controls feel wonky to no absolutely one's surprise but hey, it's there for people who enjoy it.. 5. Locking on is a joke. Whenever an enemy appears you have to play the camera shuffle for several seconds until it eventually locks on. An auto-lock feature where it automatically locks to the nearest enemy regardless of the camera would have been nice.",The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,0.1758454106280193,0.45526224982746727
7,3.0,"Played it for a few hours yesterday and compared to BoTW it's not nearly as good in how it plays, obviously a few hours means I'm barely in to the story aspect yet. Comparatively the game play is clunky, simple things like looking around and walking are far inferior to the BoTW interface. Interacting with other characters is much less smooth. To me, even the story line doesn't feel as if it's a Link and Zelda story. Bit of a spoiler here, in this world, everyone grows up with a bird-like companion that they bond with, totally different than the storyline we've seen in the past. The whole interactions between Zelda and Link are totally different. If you're expecting a game in the world you're used to with the UI that you love, this is not it. If anything think of it as being in an alternate universe and these are totally different Zelda and link. I miss the ease of controls and flow of the game much more than the different characters.

8,4.0,"Okay, so, caveats first:. I've played through OG SS a couple of times over the years and since the plot, etc hasn't changed, I feel safe writing this now after having spent a full day with the remake. Also, this is probably going to be longer than my normal review because there's a LOT to unpack here so, try to bear with me.. Overall:. The changes are really in there and they really DO make a MUCH larger difference than I think Nintendo was able to get across in advertising (yet again, smh).. Controls:. Motion controls are much more responsive and fluid now which brings them more in line with what I think they were going for back in the day.. While the gyro isn't QUITE as pinpoint accurate as they were on the original hardware, again, it's much more responsive which, in my experience thusfar-- makes it overall much more usable and the ability to calibrate at the press of a button is probably the main reason for this experience. ALSO important is that, I HIGHLY doubt that anyone that DIDN'T play the OG game, is even going to notice that teeny, tiny difference in pinpoint precision with certain moves.. Button controls are fun as well and work much better than I think the directs were able to convey. Why such a weird format for them?. Well, the gameplay itself is not the type of combat that is really easy to get across or understand just watching someone else play: combat is strategic-ish?. It's kind of a puzzle of watching for, and taking advantage of an opening. I KNOW that the description sounds the same as any other combat in a video game but, it's not. All I can really say is that it's not. There is just strictly NO WAY that they could have possibly changed the combat to accommodate JUST button presses without a FF7 or RE1 level of remake at which point, we would have gotten an entirely new game completely.. Personally? I am muuuch happier with a SS remaster with just a few tweaks and a BotW2 than JUST a new SS--- SOMETHING has to take priority here. Much as I would love it if Nintendo worked on LOTS of 3D Zelda games at the same time..... That's just not realistic.. ANYWAY, the combat is kind of quirky but.... it's actually pretty fun. I hated to admit it even when it had much more of the rough edges back in the day but, it really is some serious fun-- finding that all-important opening, taking advantage of a weak point-- even better, successfully faking out your opponent just. Feels. Awesome. It just makes you feel more.... I dunno, clever I guess?. I don't know but whatever it is for me, the button only set up works great and is fun in and of itself but, the motion control is just more enjoyable and, I canNOT be the only one! Because the spouse, who refused to play the OG game back in the day after an afternoon with it, played a little of the remake.. Not only do we both agree that the changes make a world of difference but that little taste made a convert that is finally playing SS all the way through-- with the motion controls that were so hated back then as well.. Make of that what you will but, that says to me that there are far more potential converts that loathed the Wii controls but will LOVE the new ones in the Switch remake out there. Granted, there's always going to be some that refuse to even give it a chance and/or just can't and/or don't want to ""git gud"" enough at fencing as opposed to broadsword combat and, that's fine. That is more than okay. Broadsword style combat is fun too and far more prevalent and easier to understand so, I can fully get behind just wanting to beat the bad guys as opposed to having to out think them too at the end of a long and hard day at work-- I honestly canNOT say that I don't have my days like that too. lol.. Anyway, point is that the combat is more fun than it gets credit for but it's also never going to be EVERYONE'S cup of tea. I would suggest trying a friend's copy or maybe a rental if you're on the fence.. Now, The Game:. As mentioned, combat is more like fencing than broadsword techniques. This runs the risk of making it more difficult for some players and more fun for others. In that respect, it's not un-like Dark Souls: you either love it or you hate it and it's as simple as that. Now, the improvements and the new layout WILL make it more easily accessible and/or enjoyable for more folks but, NOTHING can get around that basic core paradigm shift in fighting style. If you're not up for that change in thought, give this game a pass.. That being said, the other highly divisive thing about SS is that even though all Zelda games have highs and lows-- SS is all over the damned map. It has some of the franchise's highest of highs.... but also some of the lowest of lows. Period.. Seriously. There's going to be a point (or more) that you will actually be looking back on OOT's infamous water temple with fondness.. BUT.. There's also going to be a point (or more) that you will declare with deathly seriousness was the most fun you have EVER had in a Zelda game. Period.. Some of the best writing and characters (also some of the worst). Some of the best dungeons in the entire series (also some of the worst). And some of the best boss fights (and, yeah, some of the worst).. In other words? It's a Zelda game.. Call the barber in advance because, you WILL tear your hair out at some point. Then, strap in because, it's always one heck of a ride.. Seriously, Zelda is always fun but, there's also always something aggravating (water temple- OOT, RAIN- BotW) and SS has never been any different in that respect.. Thankfully, the shut Fi the hell up. She's not NEARLY as aggravating as Navi was in THAT OG game now. And yes they toned down Zelda's love of making tutorials that last. for. ev. er.. Visuals:. They hold up about the way you'd expect. Zelda games are known for aging well-- but they DO age. So, while it still looks good overall, there's still a few textures that aren't the prettiest on newer hardware. But, thankfully, someone managed to put away the jar of petroleum jelly that every game developer loved to smear the camera with back in those days.. Conclusion:. Is this game worth $60?. Let's be brutally honest here: that's always a personal decision. For me? Nintendo is like Disney-- they're always going to charge top dollar because they know that the fans will pay it. So, at the end of the day, you either buy the ticket to ride or you don't.. Even with the remaining rough edges, obviously, for me, the fact that some of the ones in the original game have been smoothed over has made it worth it. This game is a good time. Zelda is always a good time.. I mean, at the end of the day we all KNOW that there is more fun than annoyance in a Zelda game and while there may have been certain titles that we just didn't like, there's also been far more titles that we discovered that we loved and that means, the odds are always really, really good when we see that Triforce on the cover.. Zelda always has had it's points of contention in every entry but, there's has always been more than enough good times to be had that make up for it. Period. SS is honestly no different and never has been.. TL;DR:. Yes. Of COURSE yes. It's a Zelda and the entire gaming world knows what that means even if we don't say it as such. So, yeah, just get the game. ;)",The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,0.1345491829709708,0.5041875458495569
9,5.0,"This game is pure adventure. It plays like the classic 3D zelda games (Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess) and is a little on the linear side, sure, but that doesn't matter! What is important is the way that you feel while playing it. You will feel like a kid again, getting lost in an incredible world, secrets and dangers all around, striking out to explore new lands and get new tools. It has an incredible sense of progression, you get so many gadgets to play around with (Hookshot, Bow, Drone Beetle, even a leaf blower haha). I have sunk in 40 hours, I'm still not done, and I've been playing with the pro controller with no issues. Using the stick to swing the sword seemed unconventional at first, but after 20 minutes I was slashing with the best of them, and pulling off fatal blows and skyward strikes no problem. I missed it when it first came out on the Wii, and I'm so glad I didn't miss it again. If you want to become the hero of time, duel a skeleton king on a pirate ship, fight an ancient imprisoned evil in a cursed sealed valley, play mini games and pay off a debt by delivering soup after trashing a tavern, then this is the game for you.

1,3.0,"I really am just here to counter all the 5 star reviews of people praising this game. There is something dangerously wrong with the community when Nintendo is allowed to put out this game at full price in 2021.. Did I play the original? No. I'm new to Nintendo since 2018. Loved BOTW. Loved Links Awakening remake.. I knew this would just be an HD update but I expected controls fixed (which I read were awful in 2011) and I definitely expected it to still look better than it does. I wouldn't be able to distinguish the 2011 game from the 2021 game unless they're next to each other.. The controls are really bad. In 2021 I shouldn't have to hold down L to move the camera. There should have been a complete control overhaul and combat overhaul as well. Very, very frustrating trying to look around. As someone else here pointed out, I accidentally take the sword out all the time instead of moving the camera and it ruins immersion.. The music is beautiful. The game has a certain charm.. There really is a great game but it's mired in muddy controls and outdated mechanics. This is not worth AAA price.. In a time period where remastered trilogies like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, even 3D All Stars which wasn't a masterful update but 3 games in one......

Unlike the Wii version whose graphics were never the best, this remaster looks absolutely stunning in HD, plus it holds 60FPS incredibly well..

3,5.0,"This game is 10 years old (as of when this is written) , do NOT try to compare to BOTW, it just would not be fair for it's age. This game is clearly programmed to JUST be transferred to the Switch, no big graphic or control changes from the time it was on the Wii. Most likely since BOTW2 is still in development as of this time, that's probably is the reason why for so little change as well as the fact to keep the game as the original as possible for nostalgia purposes. Maybe stuff will change and they will give small updates over time as the release for BOTW2 gets closer. As for the controls, yes they can be difficult to deal with and annoying, but like stated, this game was obviously just a reprogramming to support the Switch, so some controls will be like the wonky ones back in 2011. To those who were expecting some huge changes, especially if your first game was BOTW (as it was for me too), don't be disappointed by this game, especially since it is one of the most linear Zelda games.

Since than I‚Äôve played just about every single game since than.. The biggest complaint I see here is‚Ä¶ people are comparing it to breath of the wild, you do realize, this game is nearly 10 years old, with mild updates, right? This is a remaster, it was designed for the wii, which was a motioned controlled game. It was never designed to have button controls. That being said, they did manage to design a button controlled scheme for this release. It‚Äôs a little clunky, you have to hold L to move the camera, since the analog stick controls the sword direction and the camera. It took me probably a few hours to do this seamlessly, as of now I‚Äôve finished the game and got used to it pretty quickly. If that doesn‚Äôt interest you, there‚Äôs always the motion controls which work better than they did on the Wii.. Many complaints about the UI (user interface). Being clunky and difficult‚Ä¶ uhhh it‚Äôs super simplistic and easy to navigate and understand. I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is, people complain about everything I suppose.. The story is great, this is technically the very first Zelda game in the timeline, creation of the world, birth of the master sword. This is the first incarnation of Link and Zelda that spawns all the other games. This story is easy to follow, the characters are great, the game is a little on the linear side compared to other games in the series but it makes sense story wise.. All in all it‚Äôs a great game, especially considering how old it is. I‚Äôd give it a solid 8/10.

1,4.0,"If you love Zelda you will most likely love this game, especially if you enjoy Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. This game very much follows that type of format where the majority of the gameplay is focused on the Temples/Dungeons.. Sadly this game is very linear. Where most of the overworld levels are one straight line/area. Very much like a late 90s/Early 2000s RPG/Adventure game like FF or Banjo. Since we have been spoiled with one of the best games of all time in Breath of the Wild, this game is a major step back in the overworld exploration department. To be honest, even when this game was first released it seemed like a step back for the series in some ways because it was so linear. Gameplay wise it seemed dated even in comparison to Wind Waker. Although the top notch visuals helped a little it was not enough to totally gloss over this shortcoming.. Although the controls have been improved greatly from the original, they still take time to get used to. While it's nice that they added the option for non-motion, it still takes a lot to get used to. The past 15 years of gaming has taught us the R stick is for the camera, not the attack. I realize this was a tough thing to modify from the original game that completely depended on Motion controls, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this still feels like you are playing an N64 game with a Sega Saturn controller. What's funny is that they didn't have the option to move the camera in the Wii version so I guess we should be thankful it's an option.. About 40-50 hours of gameplay. If you are a person that has played the series since the first game was released, or a kid that had this game 10 years ago you probably enjoy the nostalgic trip back to the past. If you're a newer fan that only knows Breath of the Wild you may not enjoy this nostalgic trip down memory lane.",The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,0.048123689727463274,0.5303563941299789
2,5.0,"I'm going to keep this short, because there are going to be plenty of reviews. I rated this game about ten years ago when it came out on Wii, and nearly a decade later, I stand by my glowing review. This game gets a lot of criticism for its control style, which I find unwarranted. I'm not sure if these people are just that uncoordinated or just not patient enough to learn something different. I tried both control styles and realized immediately that I like the motion controls better. It just makes the camera easier to control. Day 1 I put in 3 hours, and if it wasn't for the responsibilities of being an adult, I would probably keep going. Can't wait to get back to it! Quick paced while retaining the epic scope, I can't recommend this game enough.",The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,-0.019791666666666673,0.3805555555555556
3,2.0,"If you're a zelda (not just a Breath of the Wild) fan I'd recommend it just for the fact that its a 3d zelda game that starts zeldas timeline. If you're not, read on.. Pros:. -You'll get some good music. A lot recycled and some meh but theres some good stuff.. -You'll get a couple decent dungeons. 1 or 2.. -You'll 1 or 2 cool boss fights but youll have to fight them multiple times. Why? Thats a question you'll continue to ask while playing this title.. -A couple cool weapons but probably the least in any 3d zelda. -Upgrading weapons and items. Cons:. -Unfortunately, you're also gonna get an absolute ton of backtracking to the same 3 dungeons you've already beaten.. -Barely an open world. It's technically open but even if you own the loftwing amiibo it is the most tedious thing to travel around. It's not just the worst in any zelda, it's one of the worst in any game I've played. This is amplified and put on display by the constant backtracking you'll be doing.. -You're gonna get some VERY weak controls and the most tedious combat and gameplay mechanics in any zelda.. -You're gonna get some lame dungeons that youll have to replay and some that don't really have a true boss at the end. It's just Giraham over and over.. -Youll get about 10 hours at the end where you'll have every item and it feels like the game is coming to a close but instead you'll continue to back track and progress down this very linear story.. Sorry if this came off negative but as a massive zelda fan whos play all of them, i didn't want to sugarcoat it. You may enjoy this game if you can look past its tedium and poor controls.

5,1.0,"Bootleg of a Zelda game. It is almost a copy and paste of LOZ-TP but was made much more poorly than its predecessor. The controls are much more clunky, and many times actions are not registered. This happens very often during battle. The graphics and texture are that of a game that looks closer to 20 years old and not 10.. List of things that should be addressed:. 1- rupees should go to item check when no room is available or at the very least back into the chest.. 2- cannot call loftwing after falling off non specific places of skyloft. Has to be a specific place.. 3- cannot teleport.. 4- landing in skyloft is often difficult at times as I go to land at a specific place only to find out that I've been placed on the other side of skyloft after bailing off my loftwing.. 5- there is an absolute lack of a story. I mean there is a story but it's absolutely stretched so thin with no meat to give it any meaning or depth.. 6- attachments do not auto off making combat even more difficult.. 7- swimming and flying are terribly clunky as well.. 8- there is no way to relable controls to your style.. 9- skydiving controls are terrible. 10- lastly ten...All Zelda games have their own unique artwork and so forth. However, the lack of a master sword, big keys, replacing the Gorons, Zora, ect.. keep it from feeling like a true Zelda game. It doesn't hold any true Zelda artwork in my honest opinion. That is why I have dubbed it the Bootleg of Zelda games and will forever be the only Zelda game that I have played once.. I will note- I hope that whoever made this particular game was fired long ago. Im really hoping that in the very near future whoever remastered this game is also fired for half- ***ing their job and work. For what little was done to this game it did not warrant a full price. It was maybe worth $30 at the very most. This is why I'm rooting for the QC management team to also be fired..

6,3.0,"So I wanted to share my thoughts on this game as someone who very eagerly awaited this game since its announcement in February. I‚Äôve played every Zelda game save the earliest ones, and I‚Äôve wanted to play this for ages since I never had a Wii, and the orchestral score is gorgeous. I‚Äôve watched online playthroughs but experiencing a game yourself is just different, you know?. Honestly‚Ä¶I‚Äôm rather disappointed. This game has ZERO replay value and I‚Äôve finished everything in around 40 hours, and that‚Äôs with a lot of stupid backtracking on my end. The dungeons are quite fun but the items and controls are not great, and there really isn‚Äôt much areas to explore and the existing ones are tedious due to the time it takes to fly from island to island. I would have hoped this mechanism could be fixed - more quality of life stuff that just streamlines the tedious travel, but no‚Ä¶and there‚Äôs also no additional content which is really sad for a newly released Zelda game 4 years after the previous title Botw. So overall I‚Äôm happy I played it but it was a rather disappointing experience for the months of anticipation I had waiting on this.",The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,-0.10390011223344556,0.5406004489337823

This should have been a ""buttons only"" game, as the motion control is so wonky and frustrating to use. The fact that there is a ""reset gyro"" option on the settings menu tells me this was a known problem. Second, I don't know how this can even be called HD. The graphics look awful and blurry. I realize it will difficult to follow up Breath of the Wild, but this game looks so slapped together. I am no expert in these matters, but it looks like the graphics were somehow compressed to save space or something?

2,4.0,"I am a fan of the original SS for the Wii. I've played it all the way through once and it is not easy with the original motion controls. Even with the motion plus controller it was bad. I was very excited to try the new non-motion controls only to discover they are barely better than the original. Very clunky and the illustrations on how to make certain moves makes no sense. Mainly the death blow is the worst and most needed. From what I recently read it's a quick up down up movement but that is so not clear while playing the game. I went ahead and gave the motion controls a try and was blown away. So the wii had no boundary for the remote and it would 'get lost' if you weren't positioned right. There is a boundary here and no matter how close you are the pointer stays on the screen. Mind blown. Much more responsive. The game is just amazing. I'm sad I don't like the new controls but happy that motion controls are better. While many people would argue, I still think this Zelda has one of the best story lines. There are some annoying parts that are a bit repetitive but they don't bother me. The silent realms are scary enough I dream about them.

5,5.0,"This edition is an excellent addition to your collection. I love the enhanced graphics. Speaking of the controls, I did find a few things about them I didn‚Äôt particularly like but that had a lot to do with my personal preferences. Skyward sword was originally a Wii release and was designed primarily for motion controls. I‚Äôm personally not a fan of motion controls. You can still use them with joy cons, but I like buttons. That being said, the non-motion sword controls require moving the right joystick in different ways to accomplish different strikes, which I don‚Äôt prefer, but is their way of accomplishing the different strikes without motion controls. Also, in order to walk and look around requires that you hold the left bumper while using the left and right joysticks together. If you forget to hold the left bumper you can‚Äôt look when your getting attacked. If you move the right joystick without holding the bumper then you draw your sword. It can be a little annoying when your just trying to look around. You‚Äôll get used to it, I just wish they would have put more development in the control setup when converting non-motion controls to the Switch. These are small gripes as the game is still enjoyable to play and if you do like motion controls then I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have a great time.

7,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed it using the pro controller. Some can fault the finicky controls, and that‚Äôs fine, but you now have the option to play without motion, and it‚Äôs perfect. I finished and completed the whole game, including all hearts, gratitude crystals, etc. Solid 9/10.. Some complain on using the L button to be able to use the camera, but if you know this ahead, it isn‚Äôt a big issue at all. I remember having to hit the camera reset behind Link like crazy for the original one on the Wii, so simply holding L is too easy.. Graphics are nicely updated. I remember the original being too choppy and held back by the Wii, where now the characters are greatly cleaned up and cutscenes are smoother. If you‚Äôre expecting top of the line unreal engine graphics, that‚Äôs not what this game was ever designed as. It has its own art style, and that comes through well here.. The companion, Fi, is far, far less annoying in this edition. She‚Äôs never been the best in the series due to being void of emotion and a statistician, but she‚Äôs way less intrusive to the experience this time. She really doesn‚Äôt redeem herself until the very end.. All of the corrections make for enjoying some of the best dungeons the series has to offer. The ship is still my favorite..

While other games might require you to press down on the joycons for advanced moves, this game requires it for some more basic movements and it really feels like it‚Äôs going to wear out my joycons very quickly.. The controls (like flicking the joycons to slash the sword a certain way) are often very unresponsive too. Just selecting dialogue is also very unresponsive and I often have to move the left joycon several times before anything is actually selected.

The visuals are obviously way better with what looks like a smooth 60 fps. The controls are now fun to use as you can simply use the right stick to control the sword and its direction. You can also use the joy con as a sword and swing it but I am avoiding that as I don't want Wii PTSD to kick in. The story beats are the same and the back tracking can be tedious, but the overall plot, characters, world, combat, and dungeons are what keep you going. Each area is unique and dungeons are incredible. This game brings back what Breath of The Wild was missing, but don't get me wrong, BOTW was perfect for what it was and this game comes close for what it is- a classic Zelda game.

1,2.0,"I played this back in the day on Wii. I'm not entirely sure why I let myself be convinced that it deserved another chance, but I did, and here we are.. The good news is that it's a lot better than it was. If you're a series completionist and you absolutely have to be able to say you've played every game, this is your chance I guess? The bad news is, it's still not very good.. The control scheme is miles better than the old motion controls (even if you're not left handed or you don't have a disability), but it's still quite clunky. The camera controls and the need to press the joysticks in for certain commands are particularly irritating. I thought I'd get used to it, but apparently it's just not happening.. Being able to skip some cutscenes and dialogues is nice. So is the reduced intrusiveness of Fi and various tutorial features. Unfortunately, they didn't go far enough by half. The game opens, right off the bat on three cutscenes in a row, and you have to skip them all individually, one after the next after the next. Huge infodump conversations with no actual interest to them remain unskippable. The game still forcibly interrupts gameplay to open your inventory and show you where each new monster part goes; the only saving grace is that it only does it once, instead of each time you restart the game. The plot is still rigid and restrictive. The characters are still cardboard cutouts. The overworld is still not so much an overworld as a series of disconnected points in space that occasionally the game makes you land on. I'm about four hours in and I still feel like I'm just walking between cutscene triggers and occasionally being told to press some buttons to let the game know I'm still alive and haven't been devoured by my couch.. It's still got that Nintendo polish. It's still got one really good dungeon.

6,5.0,"For those who didn't get into Skyward Sword back in 2011 because of the motion controls. . . .that is no longer an issue. This HD remaster is more than a pixel and color clean up for HD, alot of QOL changes are here and definitely improve the experience of the game. As mentioned the game does not force you to use motion controls, although the game is HEAVILY designed to take advantage of said motion controls so it's still best experienced that way.. For those who still can't stand them the game now offers the option of traditional button controls by use of the Pro Controller. I've heard while it's ok for most other tasks in game such as operating the Loftwing, swimming and anything else it's great but the combat tends to be a bit janky as mentioned prior the game was meant for motion controls.. The other heavily criticized aspect of the game. . . mega Navi aka Fi. Your android like companion Fi was meant to be your assistant/helper in this adventure but unfortunately her first outing back in 2011 was handled. . .pretty badly. She interrupted the player at many inconvenient times to relay information that was either redundant or totally useless. Worse even this could not be skipped and sometimes she would speak for far too long. Now there is an option to have Fi appear ONLY in certain moments and no longer interrupts you. The other thing was she would ping annoyingly when your Wiimote batteries were low and she made this painfully aware. The Joycons tremendous battery life makes this issue non existent but I am told she will not inform you of this situation. In short her presence has been massively reduced.. One of the other big and hated small things was the fact anytime you turned off the game and then came back to it and loaded up your saved data anytime you collected monster materials or other drops you would be given the same text box to inform you of the object you obtained as when you did the first time like it never happened. This while not a game breaking issue was just absolutely exasperating after several hours of gameplay. Lastly the load times have been drastically reduced, most likely given to the much more powerful hardware of the Switch. To be honest I don't notice much of a difference I believe the original version didn't have very long load times except for a few moments but when looking up a video about this there is a noticeable change.. Unfortunately not everything is a pot of gold with this remaster. I don't recall having to recenter the cursor on the Wii version. I probably in one playthrough reset the Wiimote cursor on screen a grand total of either 10 to maybe 20 times. In about 30 mins of playing this HD port I've had to re center the cursor probably twice that amount. I've heard this was because the Wii motion control plus with its Sensor Bar made it easier to keep track of where the Wiimote was being pointed. The Switch lacks that but when it comes to the actual motion controls they feel better. Quicker response and alot less incorrect input when swinging the sword. However having to re center the cursor every 5 seconds does tend to get irritating.. The last thing to speak about is the unique Amiibo that was designed for this HD remaster is the Zelda & Loftwing Amiibo. It's bad enough Amiibo's themselves cost $15 but Nintendo saw fit to make this one cost $25, but if you find it for that price consider yourself lucky. In this pandemic era we live in with shortages of just about almost anything getting your hands on this Amiibo is nigh impossible. Unless you are willing to wait for it to come into stock and even then the prices for this thing have skyrocketed due to it's limited availability. Here on Amazon you'll see no price lower than $63 already twice the price of it's intended amount originally. With some scalpers online on other sites selling it as much as $200 I've seen.. The entire purpose of this Amiibo is to give Link a quick travel option to the sky above. Normally Link must visit a Bird Statue in what ever region he is in to return to the Sky but with this Amiibo simply tap it on your controller and you are instantly sent back to the Sky no matter where you are even in a dungeon or cave or where ever. It also sets a waypoint to the location to where you used the Amiibo, so using the Amiibo again takes you RIGHT back to where you left the surface. A nifty and handy ability unfortunately locked behind a paywall. This could have been another QOL change for the game to enhance the experience but instead Nintendo had to get greedy and didn't even bother to make any attempt to off set the fact scalpers were going to take advantage of this.. In closing there are far more positives to the negatives about this HD remaster making it worth looking into. I still don't think a 10 year old game should have come with a $60 price tag but Nintendo always treats their famous IPs like they are always worth gold no matter how old they are. If you don't mind the few negatives and the fact you won't be able to get your hands on that Amiibo then the game is definitely worth looking into if you didn't get the chance or passed the chance back in 2011 because of motion controls. . . .or you know you were into Skyrim. . . . .because that was also when that game came out.",The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch,0.018660413660413662,0.47202686202686206

Here's a PRO TIP if you would rather not use the motion sensors but would still like to play with traditional controller all you have to do to look around is hold down the L button and then you right joycon becomes your camera view (just like in BOTW) and when you dont hold the L button the right joycon is your sword.

The thing that hurts me the most is trying to get Loftwing amiibo, which has the best special power and looks awesome, and of course they didn't make enough of those, so they cost a fortune from scalpers. I still have the original SS, which I was happy with, and didn't mind playing on the Wii at all.

0,5.0,"Gave it 5 stars because there is nothing wrong as described, but parents may want to read this:. I have two kids and we already own the original Nintendo Switch and have amassed over 40 games throughout the 2.5 years since the Switch's release. The Switch Lite although nothing physically wrong with it, is completely useless to me and my family. I have two young kids, and all 3 of us have our own profiles which are linked under my main account via Nintendo ID. The problem is is that only the main account holder (me) can play the purchased games on both devices. So the Switch Lite does not work for either of my kids, only my main account. Yes, this can be switched by changing which Switch device is the ""primary"" switch, but the fact still remains that under NO conditions can my kids play both switch consoles at the same time, even if it is two separate games. If you have cartridges instead of digital downloads, you will not have this problem. I just fail to understand Nintendo's logic with this. I understand that they are trying to protect their own content from unauthorized use, but in doing so are rendering their newest device completely useless to customers like me. I will be returning.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.03749999999999999,0.5708333333333333
1,1.0,"I strongly recommend AGAINST buying the Switch Lite. Downloaded content can only be played while connected to the internet. HUGE downside and problem since this is meant to be portable!!!

This item is USELESS.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.15659722222222225,0.5555555555555556
2,3.0,"Basically a budget friendly Nintendo Switch that's meant to be more portable. Unlike the iphone 11 and iphone 11 Pro, Galaxy 10e and Galaxy 10, iphone XR and iphone X, etc it doesn't keep all features the same, just downgraded.. In fact like the Nintendo 2DS (compared to 3DS) it actually takes away some features.. If you already own a Nintendo Switch console, you can sync* or transfer from your profile/games/saves using your Nintendo account. Very simple; when you boot up system for first time it'll walk you through it step-by-step. *If you sync or link one account to multiple switch consoles, the non-main one has to verify every few hours to play downloaded games which can be a hassle if you don't have internet connection. Let's go through the list of changes:. 1. Size, weight, portability. Overall size in general: The Switch Lite is basically the Original Switch (I'll be referring it to 'Switch' moving forward) but with one of the joy cons detached.. You think this will be more portable, but in practice from my personal experience it's not. If you consider size only. The Switch can detach joycons for better storage. Downside is that you must be aware where you put the screen and joycons and attach them later.. There is a difference if you pocket thing whole thing without detaching i guess. Seeing the smaller size, there may be more hand cramping involved if you have giant adult sized hands. Switch Lite is lighter in weight, but it's not a night-and-day difference. Not going to tell unless you have both side-by-side in each hand.. Bezels are colored which is nice. It's not black like on the Switch, so able to distinguish where the screen ends. 2. No detachable joycons. Cannot detach joycons, making the logo snap/click sound clip that game trailers start off/ends with absolutely useless when referring to Switch line of systems in general.. As one singular unit, fused into the system; feels more solid in the hand compared to original. Downside is that it loses some functionality in some games. You are not able to split controllers to let a friend play. Some games that you can't play on Switch Lite out of the box (as of this review) are:. 1-2 Switch. Fitness Boxing. Just Dance (Series). Nintendo Labo (Series). Nintendo Lano VR. Ring Fit Adventures. Super Mario Party. Surgeon Simulator. There are also other games that's not as convenient to play in handheld only like:. ARMS. Fortnight. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Mario Tennis Aces. Pokemon Let's Go series. Super Mario Odyssey. Splatoon 2. Zelda Breath of the Wild. You can buy joy cons to play on Switch Lite, but that costs additional $70 MSRP. Might as well buy a Switch at that point. If the thumb sticks breaks or if there are drifting issues, you can have it fixed by Nintendo for $80.. 3. Cannot be docked to TV, no kick stand. No docking station. If you own the Switch with docking station; the Switch Lite cannot fit in it.. As of right now, there's no official docking station for Switch Lite from Nintendo, and no 3rd party adapters. No kickstand to play on tabletop mode. Seeing the smaller screen you wouldn't want to anyway even when a lot of controllers are sync and people squinting their eyes when huddled around the system. 4. Has a D-Pad.. Best feature of the system in my opinion. Better tactile feel when playing. Enhances gameplay especially when playing 2D fighters. D-pad and other buttons (ABXY, shoulder buttons) are more muted when pressed which is great when playing in a public setting. 5. No IR, HD Rumble. The IR Motion Camera and HD rumble features have been removed. Games that support these features will not work on Switch lite. 6. Better battery??. 4-7 hours versus the 3-6 hours of the original launch Nintendo Switch.. If you buy the newer 2019 model of Switch (Retail box with a lot of Red), the battery life is better than the Switch Lite. 7. New colors. Comes in Turquoise, Grey and Yellow. There's also a Pokemon Sword and Shield ( Zacian and Zamazenta) Edition edition. 8. Smaller screen. 5.5 vs 6.2 inch screen. Resolution is the same at 720p, but more compact making it appear sharper with a 267ppi vs 236ppi. Overall, I like the concept of a more portable (?), affordable switch, but I don't like the fact that it exists.. If it's like the 2ds (with no 3d support). Devs (even first party) will eventually take away features in games in the future: motion controls, AR support, HD rumble, docked TV mode, etc to cater to a wider audience.. They should have just made it smaller and kept everything the same. Good buy for those budget friendly, but if you like more options best to go for the upgrade if you can afford it.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.2291828301568561,0.4299291617473434
3,5.0,"For those who use/will use the Switch exclusively as a handheld device, I would recommend this system over the original Switch! Here are some things I've noticed in comparison to the original Switch so far:. - The Switch Lite is far more comfortable to hold and and use than the original Switch thanks to its smaller size and ' lite'er (hahaha) weight. I can hold this small boi for a lot longer than the larger Switch before having to put it down to rest my hands.. - All the buttons have that superior Gameboy Advance button feel, ie: they don't feel a tad too rigid and clicky like those in the larger Switch. Plus there is an actual d-pad here. The system is made of plastic and has a sort of coarse feel to it. It won't slip out of your hands too easily and feels nice to the touch.. - Screen size is a bit smaller- 5.5 inches vs the Switch's 6.2 inches, but this ties into the greater ease of use as a handheld as mentioned before. In terms of brightness and display quality I cannot say that I see any large differences. It's possibly a bit better since it's the same 720p but in a smaller screen? Anyway it looks great just like the original (and requires a screen protector just like the original.). - The color schemes for this system are some of the best Nintendo has ever offered in my opinion. The yellow one that I got looks fantastic and I'm glad that I chose this over the turquoise and the Pokemon themed one.. - Sound output is slightly lower in terms of volume than the original Switch. This is probably because the speakers are on the underside of the system as opposed to the front. This is a minor thing though, you'll still hear your games well enough.. - The battery looks to be draining at a similar or slightly slower rate that the original (release day) Switch. However keep in mind that the newer shipments of the original Nintendo Switch are supposed to have a larger battery life.. - You will of course be missing out on a number of features: no docking to the TV/monitor, no detachable controllers, no HD rumble or IR camera, no kickstand. However as mentioned before this a pure handheld, and I believe it serves that purpose better than its larger brethren.. For anyone who already owns a Switch and is interested in this system, it's a no-brainer. The Switch Lite is maybe the best handheld made by Nintendo so far. If you are choosing between the Switch Lite and the original Switch however, the decision becomes more difficult. I play most Switch games in handheld mode. If I had to choose between one of these today, I would probably choose the Switch Lite. If you like playing games on a larger screen, or you play local multiplayer games (Super Smash Bros. comes to mind) you probably should go with the original Switch. You'll have a lesser handheld experience, but you'll also be getting some really great features that you'd miss out on with the Switch Lite.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.23500165343915347,0.5587632275132275
4,2.0,"Do not buy this as a second switch especially if you are using family sharing. You will be forced to purchase second copies of games.. We returned our purchase after an hour of stumbling through the lack of sharing options.. Via polygon:. The lack of any kind of family sharing for games, or even just a robust digital rights system is a huge roadblock. You can use the same digital game on multiple Switch units, but any Switch that isn‚Äôt the user‚Äôs primary system has to connect to the internet to give you permission to play games, which isn‚Äôt always an option for a portable device on the road or in the air.. The only other option is to buy physical copies of your games, which means that if one member of the family leaves the house with the cartridge, no one else can play.. If Nintendo wants to launch an ecosystem of hardware to entice families to buy multiple Switch units ‚Äî which would be ideal ‚Äî it needs to figure out better ways for those consoles to communicate and share content.. Other platform holders have figured out ways around this limitation, even though the issue isn‚Äôt nearly as pressing on hardware that stays in one place, which makes Nintendo‚Äôs inability to deal with the situation even more baffling. The company always has a way of making problems that have been solved on other platforms seem insurmountable, and the trend continues with the lack of any kind of family sharing plan for games on the Switch and Switch Lite.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.13020833333333334,0.4038690476190477
5,4.0,"Here we have the Switch Lite, for those who are ready to ditch the TV and make your Switch entirely a portable device.. Let's talk about that for a moment. This is an entirely portable device, just a tiny bit larger than a Vita (for the seven of you who have one of those), and with a screen about the size of the average smart phone. The form factor is definitely smaller than that of the regular Switch, and it's much lighter. It's really very comfortable to use.. The JoyCons are no more. They still exist, in the sense that you can have external ones attached to this baby, but the system has a pair built in. Now with external ones, you could probably play some two player games together, but honestly I don't much see the point.. The screen quality is excellent. Breath of the Wild and Smash look amazing. The games play well, too. It takes a hot second to get used to the controls, but once you're there, you're golden. The sound quality is also very good.. The one complaint that I have about the system is the same complaint we've all had about Nintendo in general for years: the online component. I have two X Box 1 S systems (don't ask why), and with those, my game saves, and downloaded games are easily available on both systems. I don't even have to really put any effort into it.. With the Switch and Switch Lite, it's different. You have to go through several annoying steps in order to make it happen, and even then, you have to set up one as your primary system and the other as the secondary (I haven't been able to figure out how to do this yet).. That complaint aside, and it isn't a small complaint, I'm quite pleased. It's another worthy handheld for Nintendo!",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.09252267573696146,0.4624947671376242

7,1.0,"This system was ordered with eagerness and opened as soon as it arrived. It will not accept any memory cards. Continuous error messages. Tried with multiple cards, reformatted, nothing works.. Nintendo support did some basic troubleshooting and told me it had to come in for repair. I cannot recommend anyone purchase this system at this point. I will update my review if and when they fix the issue. For now I am stuck waiting on a repair for a system I was unable to use.. Full disclosure : I am a die-hard Nintendo fan and have owned every system including the Virtual Boy. I have Nintendo systems from the 90s that still work fine. Something is broken with the Switch lite software.. UPDATE- 10/16/2019 : the repair has been with Nintendo for over 3 weeks now, and they can't seem to find it. It may be lost internally (they have admitted ownership of it as tracking confirms it was received). Now have to wait at least another week for an investigation.. Had my system for minutes before it broke - now Nintendo looks like they will take over a month to 'fix' my issue. Will continue to post updates.. UPDATE 10/21: They 'found' the system and it is 'in service' - they say I should get a tracking # within the next 5 days - so we are looking at a 5-6 week repair window. Will report back when the actual device is in-hand.. UPDATE: 10/25. System is back in-hand. It threw a bunch of error messages when I fired it up but finally updated and now works. I sent in a 'new' system and received back one that had residue, fingerprints, and scuff marks on the case. Not happy. Nintendo offered me a 6-month window to return to fix the cosmetic case issues - I don't feel like waiting another month for a 'new' system, so I am going to see if an error message pops up in my use over the next few days. This process has been very painful and I can't suggest getting a Switch Lite given the experience I had.. The system appears to be working and seems pretty neat - will update with impressions once I've clocked some time in it.. UPDATE 2: 10/25: System is regularly, if not consistently, failing to recognize the memory card. Out of 5 power cycles, it did not recognize the card on 3 of them. System is going back to Nintendo for another round of repairs. I've asked them to replace the system since it came back with cosmetic blemishes in addition to it having the same problem. Will continue to update this review. Don't buy this system.. UPDATE 3: 11/27: Nintendo replaced the system and it works fine. Loving the system so far. I understand that lemons happen - but Nintendo's TWO MONTH turnaround earned them that 1 star.. The device, that now works, is very enjoyable.

8,2.0,"The Switch Lite was my first Switch ever. I've always wanted one, and when the Lite was announced for 100 dollars less than the OG model, I knew it was finally time to bite the bullet. I pre-ordered it, got it on Day 1, and played it... a lot. And you know what? It was amazing. Everything positive you hear about these little guys is 100% correct.. However, weird stuff started happening in my games after a few days. My character in Mario Kart would randomly turn right, and my fighters in Smash Ultimate would do the same. I did some Googling to see what the problem was... and you probably already know what I'm going to say next.. I had it. The infamous ""Joy-Con Drift"". I had it on my left analog stick 5 days after receiving my Lite.. (Background info: ""Joy-Con Drift"" is a pervasive issue that exists with current Switch controllers, where the analog sticks will start moving things in game by themselves, even without any input from the player. This is due to a fundamental problem with the components inside every analog stick. Unfortunately, every Joy-Con has the potential to drift, sooner or later. And as many tear-down videos on Youtube will demonstrate, the Switch Lite analog sticks are made from the exact same parts as the Switch OG analog sticks). You have no idea how disappointed I am. I know I can return and exchange my Lite for another one, but do I really want to? It's very likely that my next unit will develop the same problem. Maybe I'll be luckier and NOT have it happen in the first week of play, but it is likely to happen a few months, or a year down the line. When that happens, I won't have Amazon's return policy to serve as a parachute, and I'll have to send the entire thing to Nintendo directly. It's just a huge headache.. But you know what? I really loved the Switch over the 5 days that I had it. I think that speaks volumes about the quality of the platform and the games, and I don't want to stop playing. In the end, I decided to return my Lite and get an ""new-and-improved"" regular Switch. Now, I know it's just as susceptible to the Joy-Con issue, but it's a lot easier to send a single Joy-Con than an entire Switch Lite, and Nintendo have already announced that they will repair Joy-Cons completely for free.. That being said (and it breaks my heart to say this), I can't recommend the Switch Lite to anyone while the Joy-Con Drift issue remains unresolved.. As a bonus, I included a video of my drift in action. I have a few of these saved on my phone, but this one is my personal favorite, since you can see the in game cursor moving to the right EVEN AS I'M HOLDING THE STICK TO THE LEFT.

9,5.0,"This is perfect for people who want access to Switch games on a budget...as long as they're willing to go exclusively handheld.. Having used both the Switch Lite and the original Switch (in handheld mode), I have to say there are some vast improvements in handheld gaming when it comes to the Lite. Of course, this is to be expected--the device is specialized for a reason.. Basically, here were some of my favorite aspects of the Lite:. -You still get those lovely, iconic Nintendo sounds.. -Access to Nintendo Switch Exclusives. -Cheaper than the original. -Amazing, smooth touchscreen. -High quality picture...absolutely breathtaking.. Cons (which you should already know if you've done your research):. -No docking/tabletop modes. -Have to buy joy cons (and a charging port for said joy cons) separately to play 2-player games or games that are not supported in handheld mode. -The battery life could be better...playing Super Mario Odyssey, I got about 3.5 hours out of my brand new Switch Lite.. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this gaming system.

0,5.0,"When the original Switch came out, everyone wanted one. It was the most wanted console in 2017 during the holiday season. Nintendo couldn't meet the demand so sellers would offer them for exorbitant prices, for those who so badly wanted to purchase one. It was a big step up from the Wii U console that couldn't be used as a handheld console.. Fast forward to 2019, Nintendo releases the Switch Lite. Is it technically a Switch? Unfortunately, no. For starters, you can no longer place it in a dock and play games on your big screen T.V. I never used the dock/kickstand with my original Switch. Portability was my main reason for purchasing the original Switch. If you like to play games only in handheld mode, then the Lite is for you.. Pros:. 1. It's lighter and feels more durable. The Switch Lite feels solidly built.. 2. $100 cheaper than the OG Switch.. 3. Internally the same as the OG Switch.. 4. Plays almost all the games the OG Switch can.. 5. D-pad. 6. Fits in your pocket.. Cons:. 1. Can no longer play games on your big screen T.V. or table top mode.. 2. Decreased battery life.. 3. No more detachable joycons.. 4.

The screen is smaller but I really didn‚Äôt notice a difference yet with gameplay but will update in about a week. Apart from that it‚Äôs the perfect gaming console for on the go or even at home. Much easier to hold for hours at a time. Better internet connection and faster downloads than the original switch somehow though specs are the same. However : It‚Äôs annoying during setup to link your account to an existing user and also maintain data in another console like my original switch. It offers this during setup but then says you can‚Äôt until you update software. But to update software you have to complete setup creating a new user anyway. Stupid. And once you do this, then you have to go back into the menu and select save-data to cloud and sign in etc. Also you should make switch the primary console on your account- so that you don‚Äôt have to keep verifying games(using an internet connection) that you purchased on another switch previously- which is automatically set as primary. The lite is always going to be used on the go- so it may not always have an internet connection available to verify you are licensed to play the game.

4,5.0,"I was ecstatic when the first switch was announced two years ago. I've always loved the feeling of gaming on a handheld device, having grown up with the Gameboy, Gameboy color and Gameboy advance. Years later the PSP and Vita garnered my attention.. Console gaming on a TV has its place, as does gaming on a PC. However, there is something that just feels more intimate about a handheld device you can play while sitting on the couch in a relaxed position. Or even more being able to take the experience with you and combat the total boredom of a three hour layover at the airport, followed by another half day in a cramped airplane.. I had a switch since it's initial release and while it offered a good experience as a handheld it still lacked something compared to the Gameboy and Playstation devices. Breath of the wild on the go felt like a step in the right direction. But I feel as if the steps were impacted by heavy boots, an awkward and somewhat uncomfortable delivery for the experience.. I'm not saying that the switch was a bad design but it was far from ideal given my expectations. Over the past two years my switch never went into the dock to display on my TV, it resigned to a dedicated handheld that eventually lapsed into a distraction only to be used while traveling. The awkward flex of the joycons mixed with the weight and size of the switch let me down a little. But for occasional use I could see past the flaws.. Now, onto the switch lite. Immediately after unboxing and holding the device I could tell that this is what I had wanted in the switch two years ago. The weight is well balanced as my hands sit naturally onto the controls and there is no flex when gripping firmly. It's reminiscent of the Vita in all of the best ways. Only this time there's a game library that provides adequate variety.. My first impressions could be tainted by the paired release of Link's Awakening, which is wonderful I might add. Finally, I found myself fully engulfed in gaming on the switch. It was like reliving my childhood, spending hours with my Gameboy in my grasp on the very same title.. As expected, my hands didn't cramp after a half hour of use like they would with the original switch. The battery held sufficient charge to stay away from the outlet on the other side of my couch for hours on end as well. In my eyes it is perfect in every possibly way as a dedicated handheld gaming console.

2,5.0,"When I first tried using the original Switch I felt that it was too large in the hands and had a considerable weight to it which took away a lot from the handheld experience. I‚Äôm happy to say that the Switch Lite fixes all of these issues thanks to its lighter and smaller overall footprint. It‚Äôs a delight to play with and the battery life seems to be about as good as advertised. I‚Äôm getting an estimated 3.5-4 hours with Link‚Äôs Awakening which is a fairly demanding game. The screen is also extremely bright and looks absolutely beautiful. The colors are also a lot more muted than I had previously thought they would be. The Gray and the Turquoise both look very nice, though I like my gray one the most because of the nice contrast with the buttons. Speaking of the buttons, they feel extremely good. The buttons are more ‚Äúmushy‚Äù than the regular switch but feel very satisfying. The inclusion of the d-pad is also a welcome addition and it feels just amazing. It‚Äôs definitely the best d-pad I‚Äôve ever used. The d-pad has the just the right amount of tactile click and mushiness making it a dream to use. If you can forgive the lack of TV output, this is the best handheld gaming console there is and in my opinion the best Switch there is currently.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.4412777777777778,0.5613736263736264

4,4.0,"I've used my original Switch probably 80% of the time in handheld mode since I got it, so a smaller version that's handheld-only and with better battery life seemed a no-brainer to me. The original Switch isn't really powerful enough to compete with the other home consoles, but as a handheld it's huuuuuuge, and has really poor battery life. So I was actually excited for a handheld-only version - while I like the idea of a hybrid system and feel it was executed pretty well for a first attempt, I just think a more focused handheld-only Switch should be able to do the thing the system is already best at even better.. And generally, the Switch Lite does. It's better built than the original Switch - it doesn't show fingerprints, it doesn't flex or bend, and it just generally feels really solid. It also has a proper Nintendo-style d-pad, which I know is important for some people. The screen is also a tad bit brighter.. The weird thing is that it's not that much smaller than the original Switch, and battery life isn't much better either. Both of these things should have been priorities in a handheld-only device. Compared to the 3DS or even 3DS XL, this thing is massive. And as far as battery life goes, I only get about 4 hours. These are both the kinds of things people pointed to for handhelds like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear failing in the marketplace! The Switch Lite is almost as wide as an Atari Lynx II, and has about the same battery life.. The main justification for the size that I've heard is that it has to play games that are meant to be played on a big screen TV, so the screen can't really be that small. But first, the Switch Lite still has some pretty big screen bezels - as big as the PS Vita, a much older handheld. They could have reduced the system's size without further reducing screen size. But second, this is a dedicated handheld. I don't want compromises; I want a handheld. If you want a system with a big screen that can be used to play those big-screen games, get an original Switch! It can be used as either a big-screen system or a handheld; that's why it still exists. For a *dedicated* handheld, I want a small system that I can put in my pocket. I want a system designed as a handheld, not as something slightly smaller than the home version of the system.. In other words, there's just not quite enough differentiation between the Switch and Switch Lite in terms of its handheld capabilities, so it's a little hard to recommend this to someone who already has a Switch (like me). It's just not going to be all that much different when carrying it around and using it in handheld mode. That's especially true if you have the ""new"" original Switch (the one that comes in the red box) with its 1-2 hours of extra battery life. In that case, there's really no justification for buying this unless you want to play games simultaneously with your wife or kids.. But if you don't have a Switch, and you don't care about hooking up to your TV, then this is definitely the most powerful handheld ever released. It's also cheaper than the original Switch, better built and a bit smaller, so if you're only planning on playing in handheld mode, you may as well get this.. But I hope Nintendo keeps iterating (and they usually do) and this is not the last version of the Switch Lite. They really need to get it down to about the size of the 3DS XL, and with 10-12 hours of battery life. Then it'll be a 5 star handheld.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.12505398184746014,0.5048565363782757

These will be returned, and I‚Äôll eat the cost of the annual online membership and unusable gift cards from Amazon that can‚Äôt be returned. Do not buy a Switch if you are expecting your kids to be able to play on their own devices. Whatever you think a game will cost, multiply it buy how many devices you have. Yup, not worth it.

6,3.0,"First I want to say that I absolutely love the Switch; so much so that this is the 3rd one I have purchased for my household. As a system and concept I give a full 5 stars easy. However, my new Switch Lite had 2 issues that were enough for me to drop a star each.. 1. Brand new out of the box the entire left side of my console stuck and clicked audibly on both the joystick and the D-pad. Amazon quickly sent an exchange unit which did not have this issue but the experience on my first unit, along with the joycon drift on my joycons, gave me a twinge of buyer's remorse. It does not appear that Nintendo implemented their design changes into the new Lite's. I personally feel it is only a matter of time till the same issues present itself and this time I will not have option to just send in my joycon for a replacement. (Deduct 1-star). 2. The second issue is related to Nintendo's OS on the Switch. During the initial system launch my console timed-out during the system transfer and got stuck in a prompt for me to remove my joycons. I performed a hard reset and the same issue happened again. On the third attempt I opted not to perform a system transfer and everything proceeded as normal. While this is not a huge issue, coupled with Nintendo's archaic policies on game sharing across your own consoles were enough for me to deduct another star. In 2019 there is no reason I should not be able to play a digital game I purchased on any console I own without a DRM check between consoles. (Deduct 1-star). Aside from the 2 issues, I love the form factor of the Switch Lite compared to the first version. The weight feels right and there is nothing like having a true D-pad to work with. I find myself using the D-pad in menus way more than the left joystick. The reduction in screen-size has not been noticeable to me (33 year old male) even on games that usually have small font like Fire Emblem.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.11092570220477195,0.4040546662639686

1,5.0,"...and here we go.. Screen: 3. Graphics: 3. Portability: 3. Games: 5. ------------------------. Overall: 5. NOTE: Overall is not an average.. Screen. It looks good. Keep in mind that the resolution is 720P. Which in this day and age is low. That being said it still looks good. While it is not going to break any records it is more than enough to enjoy the games available for the system. Do not be scared away by the lower resolution as the games still look good and are fun to play.. Graphics. Again while it is nothing to write home about as the Switch and Switch Lite do not boast the kind of power that the more modern systems have, it still looks good when you are actually playing. I am a firm believer that graphics do not make the game. While it being a part of my overall enjoyment it is not the end all be all. The graphics still look good but if all you care about is that then this is likely not the system for you.. Portability. In a handheld console I think this is an important factor. It is big and oddly shaped. If you are going to school slipping this in a backpack is no big deal. If you are one of our vital lifeline of truckers who keep products flowing back and forth getting this in your cab is no big deal. However, if you are someone who is taking this on a trip for the kids because it keeps them quiet it is kind of hard to deal with. Not so much when they are playing it but when you have them put it away it can be cumbersome. This is of course comparing it to thigs like your phone or a 3DS. There are cases available and if you plan on taking this on the go often I highly recommend one.. Games. Ok here is the awesome sauce. The games for this are darn good. I mean they are as the kids don't say anymore 'the bomb.com"". Like seriously they are super good. This is the number one reason to pick up a Switch or Switch Lite. The games are just phenomenal. I have yet to buy one and not enjoy it from start to finish. Games like Zelda Breathe of the Wild and Pokemon Sword/Shield are big ones as we all know but there are so many more.. Overall.

6,5.0,"I travel a lot and this is MUCH BETTER for me than the original switch. The reasons for this are. #1 - Less space. Overall it is smaller in how much room it takes up in your bags or on your carry on. It's not a HUGE difference between this and the original, but enough to comment on it.. #2 - Joycons are connected. This may not be a positive for everyone but it is for me. My old switch kept on occasionally having the Joycon come off of it while it was in the case while traveling through the airport or other locations. This was annoying because you'd have to snap it back, or if it was really minor and you didn't notice it, you'd get a notice and then realize you had to snap it back. You never have to worry about this with the lite. Those who preferred removable Joycons will probably dislike this as it makes it so that you cannot really play a multiplayer game with what comes in the box, but for me it is a bonus.. 3 - Longer battery life. The lite, simply put, last longer on one charge than my original Switch did. I REALLY enjoy this feature the most out of all the differences of the Lite and the original switch.. 4 - It may be just me, but it feels more solid and durable than my original. It doesn't feel like it will break in half (Though the original has not broken in half or cracked on me yet either, it just feels more fragile like it will). The smaller size may have something to do with this.. 5 - It has a D-pad instead of buttons. I enjoy the D-pad. ON the downside, with the controls ,as the lite is smaller, for those with larger hands it can feel more cramped.. Overall, I really like the smaller size for travel, and the longer battery life (also with travel, as this is a great perk).",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.12563424947145876,0.41440148998288534

8,4.0,"So I have owned a PlayStation vita for years and I love that console. It's basically unavoidable that I'm going to end up comparing the two.. I bought the Nintendo console to get access to new games. Though I was interested in getting the original switch, I waited because I read about a number of problems, and I know Nintendo have a habit of bringing out a follow up console soon after.. I like this. It fits well in my hands. My hands are quite big, and all of the buttons are very accessible. This is an advantage for me over the vita because it sometimes felt like your hands would cramp.. Two things hit me right away about the Nintendo. Where's the Netflix app? Where's the internet browser? It still looks like a tablet, much like the original, yet smaller. So I don't see why it can't have these two things. The vita does and its ancient now. Seems like it should be added.. The most important part is the games. I went browsing through the library and there were thousands of games on there. I downloaded a few games and they came across and ready to play quickly. I can tell you the vita took forever with larger downloads. Not so with the Nintendo. I was playing within minutes.. Another feature I love is the memory. Huge advantage over the vita. Sony were basically ripping off the gamers with the absurd prices of memory cards. This system comes with 32gb. And takes any sd card. This is learning from Sony's horrible mistakes in the best way. Im so happy with this.. What I'm not terribly fond of are the game prices. I will keep my vita and plan to still play it. Some of the games Nintendo have on their library, Sony also has. There isn't a huge difference in quality but Nintendo has noticeably higher prices. Thsts a bit of a shame but I can live with it.. Fantastic mix of old and new games, cheap memory, and a nice console with a good size. Do I love it more than my vita? Don't know yet. But I will update this later with a final verdict. *** updating***. Having used this a bit now, I find that the battery drains a bit quicker than the vita does. The vita would hover around full charge for a long time, then suddenly drop to a low charge and stay there for a long time. The Nintendo battery doesn't last quite as long but the meter drops gradually. It's not a problem for me on either console.. I do find that I love the games on the Nintendo. Been playing guns gore and cannoli. It's along the same lines as rocketbirds but with an altogether different story line. But I feel the Nintendo definitely has the edge with graphics. Also downloaded doom, which is just as much fun as I remember from the 1990s. On the vita you would need to hack the thing to play that game.. As far as which one is working out better I still can't make up my mind.. Update***. It seems I am more or less ignoring the vita now. Sad to admit that as I do love it so much. Fact is though the games I am playing on the Nintendo are just better. And those are newer games too. I feel like the vita has some Important advantages over the nintendo despite arriving much earlier. You know, battery life, screen quality and an internet browser. However it's the games that matter. The vita has great games but it won't have new games. Recommending my friend pedro for adult gamers, and I'm quite liking Ghostbusters and capcoms fight bundle.. ***update***. One criticism I have of this is that for anyone with big hands you are going to feel your hands cramping and, for me at least, it doesn't even take long. I suspect it is due to the position of the buttons, sticks and shoulder buttons. I don't usually play for more than 20 minutes at a time and I feel the cramp in my hands. If you don't have big hands it might not be an issue. Though I won't reduce the rating for the console because of this. There are grips you can buy for both the switch and switch lite to help with this problem. Going to try one of those now to see if it helps.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.18157622139764995,0.5224311997526283

0,4.0,"Update (Feb. 12, 2020):. I originally gave this product 5 stars because the excitement of a brand-new handheld Nintendo console had not yet worn off. Now that I've been using it for a few months, there are a few things I take issue with.. The first issue I've noticed is that the eShop is PAINFULLY slow compared to other devices. I understand that the Switch is behind other consoles in general, but I think there's an issue when it can run Minecraft (a CPU-intensive game) better than it can run the eShop. I know that in my original review I said that the eShop lag wasn't too bad, but it can be at times. I really don't see the reason for this. I mean, it's not a smooth experience at all. The icons take a while to load sometimes and if I scroll too fast I have to wait for it to catch up. It's the same thing when I switch between the menus, too. And no, it's not my WiFi.. Now, the other issue I have is the home screen. On the 3DS, you could customize the icons however you wanted, you could put things in folders, and you could even have really cool themes! With the Switch, you don't get any of this. You get a dark mode and a light mode. That's it.. Now, if you don't care about these features that's fine, but I personally like having the option to personalize my devices. Also, it's painful having to scroll through the games you have installed on your switch because the icons are so large and you can't make them stay where you want them. It's just really clunky and annoying.. Another thing is if you're looking to you're looking to use your Switch for anything other than playing games, you're out of luck. There is no internet browser and no streaming apps. There is a YouTube app, but it's kind of bare-bones and you can't look at comments on videos.. So, for these reasons I had to knock off a star from my review. The only reason I didn't remove more stars is because I still believe the Switch is a great system with a lot of potential. I still believe that Nintendo should continue with this idea and I hope that they take people's criticism into consideration.. Oh, and this isn't really the SL's fault, but the screen is pretty small so certain games can be hard to play on it because it can be hard to see certain parts of the UI. Just something to look out for.. Also, I know some people have already been experiencing JoyCon drift with this console, but I personally haven't had a problem with it yet.. Original Review (Oct. 2019). I really, REALLY love this system.. I don't own the original Nintendo Switch, and I got the Lite because of the lower price point and the lovely colors. I also wanted to play a lot of the games that are on the Switch, but not the 3DS. I was going to wait for the Zacian and Zamazenta edition to come out, but I decided I liked the turquoise edition better and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.. Now that I have it, I must say that I am very pleased with its performance. It runs faster than I expected from a system that is so small. I haven't noticed any severe lag (although it does lag a little bit if I go through the eShop categories too fast).. Speaking of size, the Switch Lite is perfect. It's just big enough that I can see the screen just fine, but not too big that it's uncomfortable to hold. Keep in mind that I am someone with fairly small hands, so a person with larger hands may find the buttons and joysticks to be too close/cramped for their liking.. The screen resolution is one of the highlights of this system. Compared to my 3DS XL, the screen is fantastic. Seriously, I didn't realize how bad the 3DS screen is until I compared it with this system. All the games look amazing, especially Super Mario Bros. U. Mario Kart 8 also looks great.. Another thing I like a lot is the form factor. I like that everything I need to see is just on one screen and that the buttons right there beside it. It's not that I don't like the clam-shell design of the DS line, it's just that this form factor feels more comfortable to me. Of course, the form factor does come with its downsides. For example, it's going to be a lot easier to scratch the screen and the buttons. But that can be remedied if you just get a screen protector and a case to put it in.. Another thing I like is that it comes with a charger. It seems like a no-brainer to put something to charge the device in with the packaging of the device itself, but guess what? When I got my 3DS, I had to buy the charger separately. Just another way for Nintendo to get money out of me, I guess. Luckily they did not make the same mistake with the Switch Lite. I also like that the cable on the charger is so long. It makes it easier for me to charge it and play it at the same time because I can get comfortable without worrying about holding my Switch in an awkward position.. Although there are a ton of positives about the Switch Lite, I do have one complaint. My screen came with a stuck pixel. That really annoys me, but because it's kind of a light green/white I can't really see it when I'm playing games unless I'm specifically looking for it on the screen. I can only really see it when I'm in the eShop. It does suck though that an otherwise perfect system would have a flaw that can really be annoying at times. And anyway, Nintendo has said that it's a common issue with the screens so I don't expect that they would do much about it anyway.. I was pretty disappointed when I figured out that the DS line of systems is pretty much dead now, but after buying the Switch Lite I'm kind of excited for the future of Nintendo handheld systems.

1,5.0,"Pros. + Lightweight and slim for easy transport. + Great quality display. + D-Pad is far more effective without needing to replace the original Switch's casing and voiding warranties. + That feeling that the controllers were gonna snap from holding the switch with one hand is gone. + Feels sturdy like many Nintendo products. + The material they used for the case has a really nice texture. + There are no performance issues. Cons. - Obviously, any games that require separated controllers won't be compatible initially. - Battery life is noticeably small; I have to remember to check the battery every few hours to play on the charger.

2,2.0,"For starters I'm not a big fan of motion sensors, rumble, and paying over $250 for a gaming system which is why I bought this Switch.. Now for the flaws I found in this thing.. First flaw is this has no efficient instruction manual how to properly setup the thing where it took me hours of watching lot of YouTube just to linked my main Nintendo Network account without accidentally making a new account in the process which makes sign-in into my PS4 that is easy as opening a door.. Second flaw that is the biggest one to remember is the charging setup where I know you need a power cord that requires certain power setups or it'll ruin any Switch which I can get over but the main problem is when you do plug it up to the charger it'll turn on so don't expect it to off when charging it as well there is no charging lights showing if it's still charging or done charging where on the older consoles once the light is off it's done charging which is better then turning it on then check if it's done charging then turn it off.. There is about two or more flaws which aren't major like the ones I posted which is annoying but not a big problem and I'm trying to like it but Nintendo failed to understand consumer benefits compared to their own benefits which is why I'm giving it a 2 star rating.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.12758237133237135,0.4384800384800385
3,5.0,"I love having the switch lite! It feels so much more comfortable in your hands than the normal N-Switch and I've been playing much more lite switch games on the go because I'm a person, who's not home much and I love many of my switch games but I don't have much time to play them at home but with the switch lite, I can easily take it on the road with me and try to actually play them through for all the games I have for the system, for many months now and actually try to complete them and not let them go to waste.. The lite is a great buy for anyone who really wants to play switch games on the go and it is also, at a better price point for those who aren't willing to shell out the extra $100-$150 more for the standard system but still want to be able to enjoy all of the great games that it does offer..

4,3.0,"I'm a guy in my mid 30's, I live in Southern California, and I'm a huge Nintendo fan. I just got the Nintendo Switch Lite and have been playing it for the last few days. This system has a LOT going for it, but it falls short of being great.. First, let's start with the PROS:. 1. It's a smaller, more portable switch. 2. It has a regular/traditional Dpad, better for 2d games. 3. It's semi-pocketable, making it easier to take with you on the go. 4. It's pretty lightweight. 5. It has a crisp, high resolution screen. 6. There's some pretty decent games on the Switch: Mario Maker 2, Mario Odyseey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Zelda, and now SNES games online. 7. This is the first true Nintendo portable system in about 15 years that goes back to having a SINGLE screen. I like that because I thought the second screen on the DS/3DS/2DS line were just gimmicks that you didn't really need. 8. It's a portable that has console quality graphics on the go. 9. It's the first true portable from Nintendo that has an ANALOG STICK! Before, it was only a slider, now its a true stick.. 10. It's a sleek, modern looking unit.. Okay, now the CONS.... 1. It's not that cheap. $199 doesn't include the cost of the game, sales tax, shipping, a case, etc.. 2. This is the first ""portable"" system in which the games are the cost of a home console. $60/each.. 3. There's no rumble feature. 4. There's no TV out. 5. It's a switch with no ""switching"" feature. 6. The Analog stick is not nearly as good as the analog joystick on the N64. The N64 had a wider degree of freedom/precision.. 7. The DPad is TINY! I mean, REALLY tiny, so much so that its difficult to use. 8. The DPad is MISALIGNED (not horizontally aligned) with the action buttons. 9. There's no STYLUS! It's only compatible with those so-called ""styluses"" that have dull, rubber nibs.. 10. On the right side of the unit, the right analog stick pokes up at your thumb when pressing the ""B"" button. 11. It's nothing TRULY innovative. It's a smaller switch. That's it. Would have been nice if Nintendo made something really ahead of its time, like a flexible display (see Samsung Galaxy Fold). 12. No N64 games! Where's the N64 virtual console? This system would be great for that.. 13. It's still NOT comfortable in the pocket. Would have been better if it could fold up, so it was easier to take with you everywhere. 14. It's not that ""lite."" The unit has a considerable weight to it. So, I have mixed feelings about the switch lite. It's a step forward in the right direction, but I felt Nintendo could have been more careful in its design, and more daring in its innovation/delivery.",Nintendo Switch Lite - Blue,0.17468557758031444,0.5154782790309106

It's really nice to be able to keep a pair connected to the Switch and have another pair to use when in docked mode, since some games feel really nice with the joy-con rather than the pro controller, and I can still just pull my Switch out of its dock with the other pair already attached.

2,2.0,"Well well well. You have heard it before and you'll hear it again, these joycons lasted me a good two months before the left one stopped working. It drifts up and the joystick doesn't respond properly. This makes it extremely difficult to do anything, really. I play splatoon 2 pretty seriously so maybe my game-play had something to do with the short lived left joycon. I contacted the seller and they were very kind and speedy to reply. They told me they would replace it if i sent it back but I never went through with the process because even though the gimpy joycon barely worked, I didn't want to be without a controller for however long it would've taken. This is probably not a problem with the seller but the manufacturing of the product itself. Just be aware and make sure to take up Nintendo's warranty if it stops working.

3,4.0,"As an owner of the Neon Blue/Red Switch, these make a great secondary controller to allow me to customize my Switch fully in either color. The controllers feel solid and their utility as potentially two controllers helps justify the high price tag. The joy-con joysticks do not feel as sturdy as Nintendo controllers past, I've already had the side of one fold a bit when placed in a case incorrectly, and when I folded it back down over the top of the stick it left a permanent set of bumps on the nib. No issues other than that and they do feel solidly built. The matte colors are great, it's a shame the bumper guards do not correspond, nor that the buttons have any color scheme to match. They're very good controllers, the tech in them is impressive, but as the most expensive controllers I've ever purchased they do not justify their price.

I even love that they can be used as individual controllers for many games. What I don't love is the horrible drift all 6 pairs I've purchased has eventually gotten (4 different pairs purchased, a blue pair, 2 yellow pair, & the green/pink pair, plus 2 more pairs from purchasing systems). Before anyone wants to jump down my throat saying I should've gone to Nintendo, I actually have done that more than once. Nintendo did not charge me anything to send them for repairs because each time they claimed nothing was wrong with them & the very same Joy-Cons would be returned to me. Lo & behold, these Joy-Cons that were returned to me still drifted. Other than that, I've heard people say the size of these controllers aren't bothersome or small. I've also heard people say they're much too small, & I certainly fall somewhere in the latter category. Holding & playing my Switch in handheld is always a struggle, even for a short amount of time. I don't know if having sorta big hands was a factor but after a few months, most of my Joy-Cons also began having issues remaining securely on the side rails.

9,5.0,"I have both a Nintendo joycon and a pro controller. I really enjoy the joycon as it can be split into two seperate controllers and be used by two seperate people, I think its extremely innovative. The rumble features in my opinion are on par with Sony and I have found the motion controllers to be very cool myself.. However, buyers should be aware this product does not come with a grip (essentially the piece that holds the two joycon in one controller frame). It's just the two individual pieces not attached. The grip is approximately an extra 15 bucks.. In addition these controllers are likely in addition to the pair that comes with the switch. These controllers do need to charge and the only way to do so is to have them attached to the switch console itself, which means you cant also charge the joycon that came boxed with the switch at the same time without another product.. If you're going to buy the extra joycon I would recommend either a charging grip (which can be plugged in via USB- c to a wall charger or a charge station..

0,2.0,"I ordered this for two reasons:. 1 - The colors. They're perfect and fit my aesthetics well. I really do love how vibrant they are so that gets a 5/5.. 2 - My original Red and blue pair started having the Nintendo Drift (TM) problem. For those not aware: Nintendo Joy Cons will eventually develop an issue where the thumbstick will detect movement when there is no movement of the thumbstick. This is supposedly (according to the internet) due to debris getting under the thumbstick and causing a detection error. There's a lot of DIY solutions from blowing compressed air into the seam of the thumbstick to applying WD-40 or Acetone or Rubbing Alcohol under there. But since I wanted to get this color set I figure I'd bite the bullet and buy this set.. Now supposedly, Nintendo is SO aware of this issue they will repair JoyCons for free and have since the release of the Switch made adjustments to the JoyCons. Apparently this particular model was not part of the adjustment lot. After playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons for about 6 hours I started to experience the drift with these. I ended up using the compressed air trick which... works about 20% of the time.. The real kicker? Due to COVID-19, Nintendo's repair service isn't available until further notice. Bad time for my joycons to be having this problem, huh? Even worse yet is that there's a risk that if I send these in, I may not get them back! I may end up with a standard gray or Neon Red and Neon Blue pair! Which defeats the purpose.. I wouldn't warn against buying these but I would caution that if you do, prepare to keep them in a contained dust free environment when not in use and buy it with a can of air or alternatively a ""Nintendo official Joy Con Repair Kit"" since you'll probably need to clean under the left thumbstick frequently..

2,1.0,"I bought an extra set of Joy-cons in October because I wanted to play Mario Party with some friends. They worked great when I first got them, but that has changed.. After Smash Ultimate released, this is all I seem to play. Having an extra set of joy-cons allowed me to play against my friends who didn't have a set of their own, which was really nice. Until I started noticing some weird things were happening. When playing the game, my character would perform a different move than I wanted, they either would perform an up-special (recovery) when I wanted a neutral special, or would perform a neutral special when I wanted a down special (often causing my character to not counter when I wanted). At first I blamed it on myself just miss inputting what I wanted, but it got more severe. Then I noticed while on the menus the icon would constantly move up, making it hard to select what I wanted.. I tried playing in spite, of these issues, but up until this point the problem only existed in the left joy-con. Recently the right joy-con has been acting faulty as well. It would just not register button presses, leaving me repeatedly pressing the same button over and over again to try and make one thing happen. I have tried re-calibrating both the control stick on the left joy-con and the buttons on the right joy-con, but this has not worked.. What I find strange is that this is happening to my relatively new set of joy-cons. The pair I got with my switch still work great. The most irritating part of this is that these problems only started occurring shortly after the 90-days warranty expired. I take extremely good care of all of my video gaming equipment, so it is not me who has damaged them. If I had to guess I'd say a circuit component, like a resistor or capacitor, has burned out on the pcb's inside the joy-cons which would not be Nintendo's fault necessarily, but I expect better quality control of the components they are making their products out of. If the joy-cons had lasted over a year before acting up I would just attribute the problems to age and but a new pair, but with this happening only after a few months of use I refuse to but another pair seeing as they cost around $70.. Words of advice, be very careful on what you order. Products that don't last long are not worth the money. I have high standards for Nintendo products seeing as I have an original NES that still works beautifully, but this is ridiculous. I had considered purchasing a pro controller in the past, but if I have to risk it breaking after just a few months of use like these joy-cons, there is no way I am going to fork out the money to buy one.",Nintendo Joy-Con (L)/(R) Fortnite Fleet Force Bundle - Nintendo Switch,0.1138005772005772,0.5051405483405484

We purchase the yellow joy cons from Amazon a year ago, because our sons red and blue joy cons had also started acting up. The stick gets jammed and causes the characters to run in all kinds of crazy directions! It's pretty bad considering the price these things are and that they last no longer then a few months! I will never buy another nintendo gaming system again! I grew up loving nintendo products, but when they want to charge you crazy amounts for a poorly made product IM DONE! Our system has been nothing but a money pit since we purchased it! Minecraft works half the time, the system constantly shuts down, and most games are made for single player use. This is so you have to buy an online subscription so you can play with friends! POORLY MADE PRODUCTS and I will GO WITH ANOTHER GAMING SYSTEM BRAND from here on out!

The main reason I went with these Joy-Cons is to have an extra pair for when I play games with others or if I just want to give the Joy-Cons I already have a rest so they don't wear out too quickly. They can be pretty pricey, but with how many functions and features the Joy-Cons have, I personally can understand why they have their price.

The Joy Con batteries, after a week and a half of no use, start to lose power on their own.

3,5.0,My children are only 2 and 4 but we got the Nintendo switch for family entertainment during the winter. The console only came with one controller so we had to buy another one. These are not cheap by any means and I think the price has been increased due to supply and demand during this pandemic. I love this controller and even my kids can use it with ease. It is well built and functions well with my switch console. My daughters favorite color is blue but I love the fun colors and different options you can get. Having a controller that you can take apart and turn into two is such a cool concept.

4,1.0,"What to expect: only a few months of use, bought these to replace my original blue and red controllers that had drift, these came fine, although they didn‚Äôt feel like 80 dollar controllers. Felt less expensive than the wii remote.. I always keep my Nintendo switch in a nice area, where it‚Äôs safe, I wipe it down often and don‚Äôt play and eat at the same time and have kept careful consideration into its fragility, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the Amazon 3rd party‚Äôs fault. But if I buy a product I expect it to work.. Only a few days ago my joy con had a small ‚Äúbent‚Äù in it, I don‚Äôt know how it started, it was like a tiny dot at first. And then it had loosened the controllers padding, and as you can see by the picture, it fell off. well fell off little by little as the rubber slowly started peeling day by day, and one it was hanging on to the stick by a literal thread I finally decided to remove it (greatly impaired the ability to use it as my thumb would slide the analog stick and it‚Äôs rubber button around while it was falling off) and now it looks like that.. I have literally seen nothing like this happen to my other consoles, including Xbox and PlayStation controllers that cost thirty dollars or less to buy per controller, and that are from the early 2000‚Äôs nonetheless. Before my controllers padding slid off I noticed it looked like it was being held on by a cheap glue looking substance, or something of the equivalent. Being severely inexperience I have no idea how to fix this, I can‚Äôt just put it back on the controller, as it may just cause other issues/ wasn‚Äôt working when I tried at least.. But without insulation I would expect it to now break within a few coming months as a series of holes exposed for dust and other small particles to get inside and ruin it once more. As well as it‚Äôs now uncomfortable to use in its current condition. Even with the utmost care the controllers can‚Äôt stand on their own legs, especially for the average consumers knowledge.. There‚Äôs not even new controllers to buy at the store, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to buy them anyways. Would rather pay for alternative ‚ÄúKnock off‚Äù controllers that work better than Nintendo‚Äôs, or at least are the equivalent for half the price. Hope rigging the controllers was worth the mess you made.. Overall dissatisfied with the product, My highlights are that the durability of new controllers is ‚Äúlonger‚Äù than the originals (I had gotten the switch on release) by like a month more usage, which is not good at all. if you happen to be receiving a back to back defects like me and 65% of people who buy this. the problem is ongoing and incredibly frustrating.

8,2.0,"These started out great, and were mostly okay for a few months. However, the drift got worse until they are now unusable. Specifically, the left controller drifts to the left (the right one is fine!). This means that whatever game you play, it's like an invisible friend just constantly pushing your stick to the left. One solution is to ""recalibrate"" from the Switch settings menu, but this does not seem to work for me. In the image above, you can see in the calibration menu that the controller is registering a hard push to the left even though the control stick is not being touched.. This seems to be a common problem, as the joy cons that came with the Switch originally also suffer the same issue (again, only the left one). I've ordered some cheap (relatively) knock off joycons, will see how those will do. Certainly cannot be worse, as this problem makes the joycons completely unusable..

The joy-con SUCKS!. We have the blue and red joy-cons which came with the Switch. I bought the Pink & Green joy-cons so we could play Mario Party (which we LOVE). Initially, we had no problems with the controllers. I was not impressed with the range, but whatever. Also, the delay while playing wirelessly is pitiable. If you are playing any game which requires timed button presses (Mario Party, Smash Bro's, Hollow Knight...) you cannot depend on accuracy, which is downright silly. Latency is not an issue for any other system's controllers.. Now, I've got a blue controller which won't hold a charge, a pink controller who's ""L"" button doesn't register and my green controller's ""X"" button sticks. Perhaps these issues are from maltreatment. I do have three kids. But I was their age when I got my NES and I abused the heck out of those controllers and they STILL work today!. I want to love the Joy-cons. They're adorable. The ability to switch between two and one controller play is a great feat in system engineering. The Switch system itself is a GREAT system.

I was about to buy some generic ones for $5 difference, but I stick to originals for quality.. This is what happened.. I was playing Cup head with a friend, I have 4 joycons so we were playing with the grip.. I remap the shooting button to ""R"", we were playing and then I felt a plock on the button, and then it was working fine, but when shacking the controller, something was lose inside, I live outside the US (my sister took the controllers to me on a visit) so sending the controllers back to get them replaced was going to be more expensive than get new ones, but still getting new ones would be also expensive because have a couple of joycons that I got without use, so I decide to open them up and check what was going on.. What I found was a bolt got lose inside, is was one of the bolt just below the ""R"" button, I said well no problem just putting it back and that should be all.. Well nope, the place where you screw the bolt in is plastic and was striped, it seems that the bolt was over screwed, so the part was not grabbing the bolt, and that was with the other bolt as well. So even tho I screw them it wont take none of the 2 bolts and they were going to be wobbling around the controller sooner or later.. THANKFULLY I got a 2 joysticks replacements (In case that the joysticks start drifting, have read that is a common issue with joycons but I haven't experienced anything like it) which come with the tools to open them up and extra bolts if some of them gets lost, and also those bolts were A MICRO MINIMETER bigger than original bolts, so the plastic took the bolts like a charm.. Now the controller is in perfect condition, but still was not waiting this type of issue from an original controller from NINTENDO..

9,4.0,"I bought this set of Joy-cons for a few reasons - 1, to get an extra set of Joy-cons to use with the Switch, and 2, to hopefully solve a problem that I was having with the original Blue and Red/Orange Joy-cons that came with my Switch. When I would hold the Switch by the edges and try to play games on my Switch in that portable mode I would keep seeing problems with the connection between the left Joy-con and the Switch (console). As the connection on the left ""flexed"" the Joy-con on the left would think it was needing to be used in wireless mode vs. in directly attached to the Switch. Switching to this set of Joy-cons seemed to have fixed that issue, helping me to track the issue back to the problem being on the original left-side Joy-con.. I still have issues with the size of the buttons on the Joy-cons and wish that the buttons were bigger. I saw a Left Joy-con that was meant for a specific game (or sold for use with a specific game) that offered up a nice D-pad type button that I was salivating over. I liked the size of the button on there and would love a set of Joy-cons that had bigger buttons on both the left and right Joy-con so it was easier on more adult-sized fingers.. Other than that issue, there's also of course the issue of the cost of these items. They still seem too spendy to me.
